# DingTalk (Dingtalk)

This guide covers setting up a Qwen Code channel on DingTalk (钉钉).

## Prerequisites

- A DingTalk organization account
- A DingTalk bot application with AppKey and AppSecret (see below)

## Creating a Bot

1. Go to the [DingTalk Developer Portal](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com)
2. Create a new application (or use an existing one)
3. Under the application, enable the **Robot** capability
4. In Robot settings, enable **Stream Mode** (机器人协议 → Stream 模式)
5. Note the **AppKey** (Client ID) and **AppSecret** (Client Secret) from the application credentials page

### Stream Mode

DingTalk Stream mode uses an outbound WebSocket connection — no public URL or server is needed. The bot connects to DingTalk's servers, which push messages through the WebSocket. This is the simplest deployment model.

## Configuration

Add the channel to `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "my-dingtalk": {
      "type": "dingtalk",
      "clientId": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID",
      "clientSecret": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET",
      "useConnectionManager": true,
      "senderPolicy": "open",
      "sessionScope": "user",
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project",
      "instructions": "You are a concise coding assistant responding via DingTalk.",
      "groupPolicy": "open",
      "atSender": true,
      "groups": {
        "*": { "requireMention": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set the credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID=<your-app-key>
export DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-app-secret>
```

Or define them in the `env` section of `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID": "your-app-key",
    "DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-app-secret"
  }
}
```

### Interactive Cards

Add an `interactiveCards` object to opt in to DingTalk status and question
cards. Omitting the object disables interactive cards. When the object is
present, the overall switch and both card types default to enabled, and
question cards time out after 270,000 milliseconds (270 seconds).

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "my-dingtalk": {
      "type": "dingtalk",
      "clientId": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID",
      "clientSecret": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET",
      "interactiveCards": {
        "enabled": true,
        "statusCard": { "enabled": true },
        "questionCard": {
          "enabled": true,
          "timeoutMs": 270000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `interactiveCards.enabled` to `false` to disable all interactive cards.
Use `statusCard.enabled` or `questionCard.enabled` to disable one card type,
and set `questionCard.timeoutMs` to a finite positive number to change how long
Qwen Code waits for a question-card response. Values above 2,147,483,647
milliseconds (about 24.8 days) are capped at that maximum. Interactive cards
are configured through `settings.json` or the management API; the Web Shell
channel editor does not render them, and it preserves the stored object when
you edit other fields.

### Connection Recovery

`useConnectionManager` defaults to `true`. The connection manager monitors the Stream WebSocket and replaces the DingTalk SDK client when the connection stops responding. You should normally leave it enabled.

Set `"useConnectionManager": false` to disable Qwen Code's connection manager and fall back to the SDK's keepalive and automatic reconnect behavior.

### Background Agent Responses

Background Agent output is sent as soon as each response segment is available.
Every message is labeled with the Agent name so concurrent work remains
attributable.

To buffer each Agent's notification turn and send it as one labeled message,
enable aggregation for the DingTalk channel in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "my-dingtalk": {
      "type": "dingtalk",
      "clientId": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID",
      "clientSecret": "$DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET",
      "aggregateBackgroundAgentResponses": true
    }
  }
}
```

Aggregation is disabled by default. A partial labeled message is sent if the
Agent turn is interrupted, fails before producing a final response, or does
not finish within ten minutes.

## Running

```bash
# Start only the DingTalk channel
qwen channel start my-dingtalk

# Or start all configured channels together
qwen channel start
```

Open DingTalk and send a message to the bot. You should see a 👀 emoji reaction appear while the agent processes, followed by the response.

## Daemon Webhook Delivery

When the channel runs under `qwen serve`, authenticated external Webhook events can trigger unattended agent tasks and deliver the final Markdown response to either a DingTalk user or group. Use the existing Webhook target fields; no separate channel type is required:

```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "sources": {
      "manual-test": {
        "secretEnv": "QWEN_CHANNEL_DINGTALK_TEST_SECRET",
        "targets": {
          "operator": {
            "chatId": "DINGTALK_USER_ID",
            "senderId": "webhook:manual-test",
            "isGroup": false
          },
          "team": {
            "chatId": "OPEN_CONVERSATION_ID",
            "senderId": "webhook:manual-test",
            "isGroup": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Every target must set `isGroup` explicitly. For a direct message, `chatId` is the recipient's DingTalk user ID. For a group message, `chatId` is the group's `openConversationId`. Thread targets and incoming robot Webhook URLs are not supported for proactive delivery. See [Webhook-triggered tasks](./overview#webhook-triggered-tasks) for the complete channel configuration and request format.

## Group Chats

DingTalk bots work in both DM and group conversations. To enable group support:

1. Set `groupPolicy` to `"allowlist"`, `"pairing"`, or `"open"` in your channel config
2. Add the bot to a DingTalk group
3. @mention the bot in the group to trigger a response
4. If using `groupPolicy: "pairing"`, approve the group's pairing request once before responses start

By default, the bot requires an @mention in group chats (`requireMention: true`). Set `"requireMention": false` for a specific group to make it respond to all messages. See [Group Chats](./overview#group-chats) for full details.

Set `"atSender": true` to have the bot @mention the member whose group message triggered its response. It is off by default and only applies to agent replies with a DingTalk staff ID. Replies are sent as DingTalk markdown whether or not they carry a mention; the mention prefix is included in the first message chunk.

### Finding a Group's Conversation ID

DingTalk uses `conversationId` to identify groups. You can find it in the channel service logs when someone sends a message in the group — look for the `conversationId` field in the log output.

## Images and Files

You can send photos and documents to the bot, not just text.

**Photos:** Send an image (screenshot, diagram, etc.) and the agent will analyze it using its vision capabilities. This requires a multimodal model — add `"model": "qwen3.5-plus"` (or another vision-capable model) to your channel config. DingTalk supports sending images directly or as part of rich text messages (mixed text + images).

**Files:** Send a PDF, code file, or any document. The bot downloads it from DingTalk's servers and saves it locally so the agent can read it with its file tools. Audio and video files are also supported. This works with any model.

**Generated files:** Ask the agent explicitly to send a completed local file and it can return the file as a native DingTalk attachment. Files must be non-empty, no larger than 20 MB, and located inside the configured workspace or the system temporary directory. One response can send at most five files. Outbound file attachments are unavailable when `blockStreaming` is set to `"on"`; upload or delivery failures are reported in the final text instead.

## Forwarded Chat Records

You can merge-forward a run of messages from another chat to the bot (DingTalk's "combined forward"), either as a message of its own or as the message you are replying to. The bot expands the record into text for the agent: the record's title and summary become a header line, and each forwarded message is listed under `[Chat record messages]` as `Sender: message`. A forwarded message whose body is not text is shown as a placeholder — `[image]`, `[file: <name>]`, `[audio]`, `[video]`.

Long records are **capped, and the cap is announced**: at most 50 messages, at most 4000 characters in total, and at most 500 characters per message. Whatever is cut is reported to the agent in the same text — a trailing `[N more message(s) not shown]` line for dropped messages, and a ` [truncated]` marker on any message that was shortened. So the agent knows it is answering about a partial record; if you need the whole thing, forward it in smaller batches.

A record you are **replying to** is quoted rather than sent, and quoted text is capped at 500 characters on every channel — so the record is rendered to that 500-character budget instead of the 4000-character one, and the same announcements apply within it. Expect a replied record to carry its header and the first message or two; forward it as its own message to give the agent the whole thing.

Because a forwarded record is written by people other than you, everything lifted out of it — titles, sender names, message bodies — is neutralized before it reaches the agent, so a forwarded message cannot pose as an instruction to the bot.

The multi-line layout above is what the agent sees in a 1:1 chat. In a group the whole message is neutralized a second time before it reaches the agent, which folds it onto one line and drops the square brackets around the markers; the content and the cap announcements are the same either way.

## Key Differences from Telegram

- **Authentication:** AppKey + AppSecret instead of a static bot token. The SDK manages access token refresh automatically.
- **Connection:** WebSocket stream instead of polling — no public IP or webhook URL needed.
- **Formatting:** Responses use DingTalk's markdown dialect. Markdown tables are passed through to the DingTalk client; long messages are split into chunks at ~3800 characters.
- **Working indicator:** A 👀 emoji reaction is added to the user's message while processing, then removed when the response is sent.
- **Media download:** Two-step process — a `downloadCode` from the message is exchanged for a temporary download URL via DingTalk's API.
- **Groups:** DingTalk uses `isInAtList` for @mention detection instead of parsing message entities.

## Tips

- **Use DingTalk markdown-aware instructions** — DingTalk supports headings, bold text, links, code blocks, and tables. Keep tables compact because narrow screens may scroll horizontally.
- **Restrict access** — In an organization context, `senderPolicy: "open"` may be acceptable. For tighter control, use `"allowlist"` or `"pairing"`. See [DM Pairing](./overview#dm-pairing) for details.
- **Referenced messages** — Quoting (replying to) a user message includes the quoted text as context for the agent. If the quoted message is a picture, file, audio, or video message, the bot downloads and attaches it the same way as when sent directly. Quoting bot responses is not yet supported.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't connect

- Verify your AppKey and AppSecret are correct
- Check that the environment variables are set before running `qwen channel start`
- Make sure **Stream Mode** is enabled in the bot's settings on the DingTalk Developer Portal
- Check the terminal output for connection errors

### Bot doesn't respond in groups

- Check that `groupPolicy` is set to `"allowlist"`, `"pairing"`, or `"open"` (default is `"disabled"`)
- If using `"pairing"`, verify the group's pairing request has been approved
- Make sure you @mention the bot in the group message
- Verify the bot has been added to the group

### "No sessionWebhook in message"

This means DingTalk didn't include a reply endpoint in the message callback. This can happen if the bot's permissions are misconfigured. Check the bot's settings in the Developer Portal.

### "Unable to process this message"

The reply identifies the failure category and suggests a next step. If the problem continues, give the bot administrator the reference shown in the reply; the same reference appears beside the detailed error in the channel process log.
