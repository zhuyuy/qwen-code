# Authentication

Qwen Code's first-run `/auth` menu has three top-level options. Pick the one that matches how you want to run the CLI:

- **Alibaba ModelStudio**: official recommended setup. Opens a sub-menu with **Coding Plan** (for individual developers · weekly quota included), **Token Plan** (for teams and companies · usage-based billing with a dedicated endpoint), or **Standard API Key** (connect with an existing ModelStudio API key).
- **Third-party Providers**: choose a built-in provider and connect with an API key (DeepSeek, Grok, MiniMax, Z.AI, Kimi, Idealab, ModelScope, OpenRouter, Requesty).
- **Custom Provider**: manually connect a local server, proxy, or unsupported provider — supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and other compatible endpoints.

> [!note]
>
> **Qwen OAuth** is no longer a selectable dialog entry — its free tier was discontinued on 2026-04-15. It remains documented below as a hard-coded, discontinued provider only.

## Option 1: Qwen OAuth (Discontinued)

> [!warning]
>
> The Qwen OAuth free tier was discontinued on 2026-04-15. Existing cached tokens may continue working briefly, but new requests will be rejected. Please switch to Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan, [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), [Fireworks AI](https://app.fireworks.ai), or another provider. Run `qwen` and use `/auth` to configure.

- **How it works**: on first start, Qwen Code opens a browser login page. After you finish, credentials are cached locally so you usually won't need to log in again.
- **Requirements**: a `qwen.ai` account + internet access (at least for the first login).
- **Benefits**: no API key management, automatic credential refresh.
- **Cost & quota**: the free tier has been discontinued as of 2026-04-15.

Start the CLI and follow the browser flow:

```bash
qwen
```

Qwen OAuth is no longer offered as a selectable entry in the `/auth` dialog; run `/auth` and choose one of the current options (Alibaba ModelStudio, Third-party Providers, or Custom Provider) instead.

> [!note]
>
> In non-interactive or headless environments (e.g., CI, SSH, containers), you typically **cannot** complete the OAuth browser login flow.
> In these cases, please use the Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan or API Key authentication method.

## 💳 Option 2: Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan

Use this if you want predictable costs with diverse model options and higher usage quotas.

- **How it works**: Subscribe to the Coding Plan with a fixed monthly fee, then configure Qwen Code to use the dedicated endpoint and your subscription API key.
- **Requirements**: Obtain an active Coding Plan subscription from [Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio(Beijing)](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing?tab=coding-plan#/efm/coding-plan-index) or [Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio(intl)](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/?tab=coding-plan#/efm/coding-plan-index), depending on the region of your account.
- **Benefits**: Diverse model options, higher usage quotas, predictable monthly costs, access to a wide range of models (Qwen, GLM, Kimi, Minimax and more).
- **Cost & quota**: View Aliyun ModelStudio Coding Plan documentation[Beijing](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=3005961)[intl](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=2840914).

Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan is available in two regions:

| Region                       | Console URL                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aliyun ModelStudio (Beijing) | [bailian.console.aliyun.com](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com)             |
| Alibaba Cloud (intl)         | [bailian.console.alibabacloud.com](https://bailian.console.alibabacloud.com) |

### Interactive setup

Enter `qwen` in the terminal to launch Qwen Code, then run the `/auth` command, select **Alibaba ModelStudio**, and choose **Coding Plan** from the sub-menu. Choose your region, then enter your `sk-sp-xxxxxxxxx` key.

After authentication, use the `/model` command to switch between all Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan supported models (including qwen3.5-plus, qwen3.6-plus, qwen3.7-plus, qwen3-coder-plus, qwen3-coder-next, qwen3-max-2026-01-23, glm-5, glm-4.7, kimi-k2.5, and MiniMax-M2.5).

### Headless or scripted setup

For CI, containers, or scripts, configure Coding Plan with environment variables or `settings.json` instead of the removed `qwen auth coding-plan` command.

```bash
export BAILIAN_CODING_PLAN_API_KEY="sk-sp-xxxxxxxxx"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://coding.dashscope.aliyuncs.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="qwen3-coder-plus"
```

Use `https://coding.dashscope.aliyuncs.com/v1` for the China (Beijing) endpoint, or `https://coding-intl.dashscope.aliyuncs.com/v1` for the international endpoint.

### Alternative: configure via `settings.json`

If you prefer to skip the interactive `/auth` flow, add the following to `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "modelProviders": {
    "openai": [
      {
        "id": "qwen3-coder-plus",
        "name": "qwen3-coder-plus (Coding Plan)",
        "baseUrl": "https://coding.dashscope.aliyuncs.com/v1",
        "description": "qwen3-coder-plus from Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan",
        "envKey": "BAILIAN_CODING_PLAN_API_KEY"
      }
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "BAILIAN_CODING_PLAN_API_KEY": "sk-sp-xxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "security": {
    "auth": {
      "selectedType": "openai"
    }
  },
  "model": {
    "name": "qwen3-coder-plus"
  }
}
```

> [!note]
>
> The Coding Plan uses a dedicated endpoint (`https://coding.dashscope.aliyuncs.com/v1`) that is different from the standard Dashscope endpoint. Make sure to use the correct `baseUrl`.

## 🪙 Option 3: Alibaba Cloud Token Plan

Use this if your team or company prefers usage-based billing on a dedicated ModelStudio endpoint.

- **How it works**: Subscribe to the Token Plan in Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio, then configure Qwen Code to use the region-specific Token Plan endpoint and your API key. You are billed for actual token usage instead of a fixed monthly fee.
- **Requirements**: Obtain a Token Plan API key from [Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio(Beijing)](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=3028856) or [Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio(intl)](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/ap-southeast-1?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model), depending on the region of your account.
- **Benefits**: Usage-based billing for teams and companies, dedicated region-specific endpoints, access to a wide range of models (Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, Minimax and more).
- **Cost & quota**: View Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio Token Plan documentation [Beijing](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=3028856) [intl](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/ap-southeast-1?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model).

Token Plan is available in two regions, each with its own dedicated endpoint:

| Region                    | Endpoint                                                                 | Console URL                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| China (Beijing)           | `https://token-plan.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`     | [bailian.console.aliyun.com](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing)                         |
| Singapore (International) | `https://token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | [modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/ap-southeast-1) |

### Interactive setup

Enter `qwen` in the terminal to launch Qwen Code, then run the `/auth` command, select **Alibaba ModelStudio**, and choose **Token Plan** from the sub-menu. Choose your region (**China (Beijing)** or **Singapore (International)**), then enter your API key. The wizard then shows its final step (Step 3/3 · Model IDs), where you pick the model IDs to configure: the models served by your endpoint are offered there and are applied only when you explicitly select them. Token Plan API keys have no prefix requirement (unlike Coding Plan keys, which start with `sk-sp-`).

After authentication, use the `/model` command to browse and switch between the models configured for your Token Plan. The model lineup evolves over time, so it is intentionally not listed here; model discovery from the endpoint happens during the `/auth` setup step above (the endpoint's own list is offered there and must be selected explicitly), and `/model` then shows the models configured for your plan.

### Headless or scripted setup

For CI, containers, or scripts, configure Token Plan with environment variables or `settings.json` instead of the interactive `/auth` flow.

```bash
export BAILIAN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://token-plan.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="qwen3.7-plus"
```

Use `https://token-plan.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` for the China (Beijing) endpoint, or `https://token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` for the international (Singapore) endpoint. Replace `qwen3.7-plus` with any model included in your plan.

Note that `BAILIAN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` is a provider-specific key: it takes effect once the `settings.json` provider entry in the next section exists, because that entry declares it as the `envKey`. To select OpenAI-compatible auth with environment variables alone, export `OPENAI_API_KEY` instead — provider-specific keys do not select the auth type by themselves.

### Alternative: configure via `settings.json`

If you prefer to skip the interactive `/auth` flow, add the following to `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "modelProviders": {
    "openai": [
      {
        "id": "qwen3.7-plus",
        "name": "qwen3.7-plus (Token Plan)",
        "baseUrl": "https://token-plan.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
        "description": "qwen3.7-plus from Alibaba Cloud Token Plan",
        "envKey": "BAILIAN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY"
      }
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "BAILIAN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
  },
  "security": {
    "auth": {
      "selectedType": "openai"
    }
  },
  "model": {
    "name": "qwen3.7-plus"
  }
}
```

> [!note]
>
> The Token Plan uses dedicated, region-specific endpoints (`*.maas.aliyuncs.com`) that are different from the standard DashScope endpoint. Make sure the `baseUrl` matches the region of your subscription.

## 🚀 Option 4: API Key (flexible)

Use this if you want to connect to third-party providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, Requesty, ModelScope, or a self-hosted endpoint. Supports multiple protocols and providers.

### Recommended: One-file setup via `settings.json`

The simplest way to get started with API Key authentication is to put everything in a single `~/.qwen/settings.json` file. Here's a complete, ready-to-use example:

```json
{
  "modelProviders": {
    "openai": [
      {
        "id": "qwen3-coder-plus",
        "name": "qwen3-coder-plus",
        "baseUrl": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
        "description": "Qwen3-Coder via Dashscope",
        "envKey": "DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"
      }
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "DASHSCOPE_API_KEY": "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "security": {
    "auth": {
      "selectedType": "openai"
    }
  },
  "model": {
    "name": "qwen3-coder-plus"
  }
}
```

What each field does:

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modelProviders`             | Declares which models are available and how to connect to them. Keys (`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`) represent the API protocol.              |
| `env`                        | Stores API keys directly in `settings.json` as a fallback (lowest priority — shell `export` and `.env` files take precedence).                  |
| `security.auth.selectedType` | Tells Qwen Code which protocol to use on startup (e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`). Without this, you'd need to run `/auth` interactively. |
| `model.name`                 | The default model to activate when Qwen Code starts. Must match one of the `id` values in your `modelProviders`.                                |

After saving the file, just run `qwen` — no interactive `/auth` setup needed.

> [!tip]
>
> The sections below explain each part in more detail. If the quick example above works for you, feel free to skip ahead to [Security notes](#security-notes).

The key concept is **Model Providers** (`modelProviders`): Qwen Code supports multiple API protocols, not just OpenAI. You configure which providers and models are available by editing `~/.qwen/settings.json`, then switch between them at runtime with the `/model` command.

#### Supported protocols

| Protocol          | `modelProviders` key | Environment variables                                                                                                                                          | Providers                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `openai`             | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_MODEL` (alias: `QWEN_MODEL`)                                                                                      | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, Requesty, ModelScope, Alibaba Cloud, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Anthropic         | `anthropic`          | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`                                                                                                   | Anthropic Claude                                                                                      |
| Google GenAI      | `gemini`             | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`                                                                                                                               | Google Gemini                                                                                         |
| Vertex AI         | `vertex-ai`          | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_MODEL` (sets `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`) or `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` + `GOOGLE_MODEL` (keyless ADC); uses the `gemini` protocol | Google Vertex AI                                                                                      |

#### Step 1: Configure models and providers in `~/.qwen/settings.json`

Define which models are available for each protocol. Each model entry requires at minimum an `id`; `envKey` (the environment variable name that holds your API key) is optional and recommended — when omitted, it falls back to the auth type's default env key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai`).

> [!important]
>
> It is recommended to define `modelProviders` in the user-scope `~/.qwen/settings.json` to avoid merge conflicts between project and user settings.

Edit `~/.qwen/settings.json` (create it if it doesn't exist). You can mix multiple protocols in a single file — here is a multi-provider example showing just the `modelProviders` section:

```json
{
  "modelProviders": {
    "openai": [
      {
        "id": "gpt-4o",
        "name": "GPT-4o",
        "envKey": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
        "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      }
    ],
    "anthropic": [
      {
        "id": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
        "envKey": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
      }
    ],
    "gemini": [
      {
        "id": "gemini-2.5-pro",
        "name": "Gemini 2.5 Pro",
        "envKey": "GEMINI_API_KEY"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> [!tip]
>
> Don't forget to also set `env`, `security.auth.selectedType`, and `model.name` alongside `modelProviders` — see the [complete example above](#recommended-one-file-setup-via-settingsjson) for reference.

**`ModelConfig` fields (each entry inside `modelProviders`):**

| Field              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | Yes      | Model ID sent to the API (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)                                                                               |
| `name`             | No       | Display name in the `/model` picker (defaults to `id`)                                                                                             |
| `envKey`           | No       | Environment variable name for the API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`); optional/recommended — defaults to the auth type's default env key when omitted |
| `baseUrl`          | No       | API endpoint override (useful for proxies or custom endpoints)                                                                                     |
| `generationConfig` | No       | Fine-tune `timeout`, `maxRetries`, `samplingParams`, etc.                                                                                          |

> [!note]
>
> When using the `env` field in `settings.json`, credentials are stored in plain text. For better security, prefer `.env` files or shell `export` — see [Step 2](#step-2-set-environment-variables).

For the full `modelProviders` schema and advanced options like `generationConfig`, `customHeaders`, and `extra_body`, see [Model Providers Reference](model-providers.md).

#### Step 2: Set environment variables

Qwen Code reads API keys from environment variables (specified by `envKey` in your model config). There are multiple ways to provide them, listed below from **highest to lowest priority**:

**1. Shell environment / `export` (highest priority)**

Set directly in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) or inline before launching:

```bash

# Alibaba Dashscope
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="sk-..."

# OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Google GenAI
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
```

**2. `.env` files**

Qwen Code auto-loads the **first** `.env` file it finds (variables are **not merged** across multiple files). Only variables not already present in `process.env` are loaded.

Search order (from the current directory, walking upward toward `/`):

1. `.qwen/.env` (preferred — keeps Qwen Code variables isolated from other tools)
2. `.env`

If nothing is found, it falls back to your **home directory**:

3. `~/.qwen/.env`
4. `~/.env`

> [!tip]
>
> `.qwen/.env` is recommended over `.env` to avoid conflicts with other tools. Some variables (like `DEBUG` and `DEBUG_MODE`) are excluded from project-level `.env` files to avoid interfering with Qwen Code behavior.

**3. `settings.json` → `env` field (lowest priority)**

You can also define API keys directly in `~/.qwen/settings.json` under the `env` key. These are loaded as the **lowest-priority fallback** — only applied when a variable is not already set by the system environment or `.env` files.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DASHSCOPE_API_KEY": "sk-...",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-...",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..."
  }
}
```

This is the approach used in the [one-file setup example](#recommended-one-file-setup-via-settingsjson) above. It's convenient for keeping everything in one place, but be mindful that `settings.json` may be shared or synced — prefer `.env` files for sensitive secrets.

**Priority summary:**

| Priority    | Source                         | Override behavior                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (highest) | CLI flags (`--openai-api-key`) | Always wins                                  |
| 2           | System env (`export`, inline)  | Overrides `.env` and `settings.json` → `env` |
| 3           | `.env` file                    | Only sets if not in system env               |
| 4 (lowest)  | `settings.json` → `env`        | Only sets if not in system env or `.env`     |

#### Step 3: Switch models with `/model`

After launching Qwen Code, use the `/model` command to switch between all configured models. Models are grouped by protocol:

```
/model
```

The picker will show all models from your `modelProviders` configuration, grouped by their protocol (e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`). Your selection is persisted across sessions.

You can also switch models directly with a command-line argument, which is convenient when working across multiple terminals.

```bash
# In one terminal

qwen --model "qwen3-coder-plus"

# In another terminal

qwen --model "qwen3.5-plus"
```

## Removed `qwen auth` CLI command

The standalone `qwen auth` CLI command has been removed. Use these replacements instead:

| Previous use case                | Replacement                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interactive authentication setup | Run `qwen`, then use `/auth`                                                                  |
| Coding Plan setup                | Use `/auth`, or set `BAILIAN_CODING_PLAN_API_KEY` with the Coding Plan base URL               |
| Token Plan setup                 | Use `/auth`, or set `BAILIAN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` with the Token Plan base URL for your region |
| OpenRouter setup                 | Use `/auth`, or set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`   |
| Requesty setup                   | Use `/auth`, or set `REQUESTY_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://router.requesty.ai/v1`    |
| API-key or custom provider setup | Configure `~/.qwen/settings.json`, `.env`, or provider-specific environment variables         |
| Check current authentication     | Run `/doctor` inside Qwen Code                                                                |
| OAuth browser flow               | Run `qwen` interactively and use `/auth`; OAuth cannot be configured with env vars alone      |

Legacy invocations such as `qwen auth status` print a removal notice that summarizes these migration paths, including a Token Plan entry with the base URLs for both regions.

## Security notes

- Don't commit API keys to version control.
- Prefer `.qwen/.env` for project-local secrets (and keep it out of git).
- Treat your terminal output as sensitive if it prints credentials for verification.
