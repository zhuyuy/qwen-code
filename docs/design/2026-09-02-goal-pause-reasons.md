# Pausing a Goal, and saying why

## Problem

Two gaps, both visible the moment a user interrupts an autonomous Goal.

**A cancelled tool batch leaves the Goal's history malformed.** Cancelling a
Goal turn does stop the Goal -- pressing Esc while tools run aborts the
continuation owner's signal, and the cancelled-continuation branch in
`use-llm-stream.ts` pauses the turn. What that branch does not do is answer
the model's function calls: it marks the batch submitted, which stops those
callIds ever being submitted again, so the `functionCall` parts stay unpaired
and the next `/goal resume` sends a history with a call that has no response.
The all-cancelled branch below it writes those responses; the cancelled
continuation, which is the branch a user's Esc actually reaches, does not.
This is the Goal-shaped form of the misattribution reported in issue #10170.

**No pause says why it happened.** `reduceGoalControl` leaves `lastReason`
untouched on a pause, and no host supplies one. The field is rendered as the
reason a Goal is in its current state, so a paused Goal shows either nothing
or the previous turn's verifier rejection -- which explains why the Goal was
still running, not why it stopped. Six pause sites across the interactive TUI,
ACP, and headless are affected, and they cover events as different as a user
interrupt, a spent model output budget, a Stop-hook cap, and a failed turn.

## Design

`GoalControlRequest`'s `pause` variant gains an optional `reason`. The reducer
writes it to `lastReason`, and a pause without one clears the field rather
than inheriting a stale value. Every existing renderer already shows
`lastReason` for a non-active Goal, so the TUI card, `/goal`, the ACP
`_meta.goalState` update, and the headless `goal_state` event all carry the
reason with no per-host UI work.

No new `GoalStateCause` is introduced. The cause stays `pause`, which keeps
the change out of the state parsers, the persistence format, the legacy
projection, the ACP error mapping, and `shouldDisplayGoalStateCause`.

The reasons themselves are constants in `goal-protocol.ts` rather than
per-host prose, so the same event reads the same way everywhere and a test can
assert on the event instead of one host's wording: a user interrupt, `/goal
pause`, the session token limit, a closed session, the Stop-hook cap, plus
two builders for a failed turn and a spent headless run budget. `parseGoalControlRequest`
accepts a reason only on `pause`, and only a non-empty string within
`GOAL_PAUSE_REASON_MAX_CHARACTERS`, so the HTTP and ACP control paths cannot
inject unbounded text into a card.

For the first gap, the branch that a cancelled Goal tool batch actually takes
now writes the batch's responses to history before it stops, so every function
call stays paired with a response and the history the next Goal turn resumes
from stays well-formed. The pairing belongs there rather than in a branch
further down: a batch whose continuation was cancelled returns before either
of them, and a second pause on an already-paused Goal throws.

A declined tool confirmation is a user action, not a failed turn. The dialog
consumes the Esc, so `turnCancelledRef` never flips and the batch settles on
the all-cancelled branch; that branch selects the user-interrupt reason
unconditionally rather than reading a ref only `cancelOngoingRequest` writes.
What it does _not_ do is stop a Goal whose batch was only partly declined --
that batch still goes back to the model, as it always has outside Goals, so
the model can adapt. Whether an autonomous Goal should stop on a per-tool
denial is a separate design question from this change, which is about what a
stop _says_; the inconsistency between the two batch shapes is recorded here
rather than settled.

Every host that pauses supplies a reason, the Web Shell included: a pause
without one now clears `lastReason`, and the Web Shell card renders that
field, so an unreasoned pause there would blank the line the user is reading.
The SDK's hand-duplicated `GoalControlRequest` splits `pause` out of its
shared arm to carry the field, because the daemon's parser rejects any extra
key on `resume` and `clear`. Known follow-up: both Web Shell sites label the
field `t('goal.lastCheck')` ("Last check"), wording written for verifier text
and not for a pause reason.

Ordinary tool cancellation outside a Goal turn is unchanged; that is the
subject of #10170 and PR #10180.

## Scope

- `goal-protocol.ts`: the optional `reason`, its validator and bound, the
  shared reason constants and the two builders.
- `goal-reducer.ts`: pause writes or clears `lastReason`; resuming a paused
  Goal clears it, so a running Goal never renders the prose that explains why
  it stopped; the parser accepts a reason on `pause` only.
- `goal-protocol.ts` (second pass): the validator bounds its work by the
  limit rather than by the input, since the control routes are
  network-reachable and synchronous on the CLI's event loop; a headless run
  that outlives its Goal gets its own reason rather than being framed as a
  failed turn.
- `sdk-typescript/daemon/types.ts` + `web-shell/utils/goalControlRequest.ts`:
  the pause variant carries `reason`, and the Web Shell attaches the shared
  `/goal pause` prose.
- `client.ts`: the interrupted-exit pause carries a reason. It runs before
  every host's own reasoned pause and a second pause on a non-active Goal
  throws, so this is the dispatch that decides what the record says -- a
  caller-aborted exit is a user interrupt, an exit that merely failed to
  complete is a failed turn, and the Stop-hook cap names itself. A host may
  supply its own wording for an interrupted exit, and is handed the error
  that ended the turn when there was one, so a headless run's stop reads in
  the headless register rather than in the interactive one.
- `use-llm-stream.ts`: `failClosedGoalTurn` takes a `userCancelled` flag and
  picks the matching reason; the cancelled-continuation branch pairs the
  batch's responses into history before it stops.
- `goalCommand.ts`: `/goal pause` names itself.
- `Session.ts`: four ACP pause sites choose among user interrupt, output
  limit, session disposal, turn failure, and the Stop-hook cap. A close or a
  managed shutdown aborts with the dispose sentinel so it is not recorded as
  the user's own cancel, and the disposal wording says the session _started_
  closing -- a close that is later abandoned must not leave a record claiming
  something that did not happen.
- `nonInteractiveCli.ts`: the headless helper takes an explicit pause reason;
  the two writers that actually settle a budget stop -- the outer catch and
  the abort listener inside `finishGoalTurn` -- name the budget that tripped;
  a non-budget abort in the settle window is a user interrupt, the same as
  the identical abort a moment earlier or later; a successful
  structured-output exit no longer reads as a failed turn; and TEXT output
  prints the reason for every non-active status, not just `blocked` and
  `usage_limited`.
- `docs/users/features/goals.md`: a section on interrupting a Goal.

## Verification

- `goal-reducer.test.ts`: a supplied reason is recorded; a reasonless pause
  clears a stale one; a resume clears a pause reason but keeps a blocked
  Goal's; the parser accepts a valid reason and rejects empty, oversized,
  non-string, and reasons on `resume`/`clear`.
- `client-goal.test.ts`: the interrupted-exit pause carries the user-interrupt
  reason when the caller aborted, the failed-turn reason when it did not, and
  the Stop-hook cap reason at the cap.
- `goal-runtime.test.ts`: the reason is journalled with the paused snapshot,
  and a `releaseTurn` arriving after the pause schedules no continuation.
- `use-llm-stream.test.tsx`: a partly cancelled Goal tool batch pauses with
  the user-interrupt reason, pairs both responses into history, and never
  reaches the model; a preempted batch and a batch cancelled inside the
  boundary drain pair their responses too; a partly _declined_ batch goes
  back to the model without pausing; and a turn that ends with no valid
  continuation records the failure sentence rather than the scheduler's own
  diagnostic.
- `goalCommand.test.ts` and `Session.test.ts` pin the reason each pause site
  sends.
- `goal-protocol.test.ts`: the shared constants validate, the bound is
  measured in code points and accepts exactly the limit, and both builders
  produce reasons the validator accepts however long the detail.
- `goalControlRequest.test.ts`: a Web Shell pause carries the reason and
  `resume`/`clear` carry no `reason` key.
- An E2E plan in `.qwen/e2e-tests/goal-pause-reasons.md` covers the three
  interactive cancel shapes and `/goal pause`.
