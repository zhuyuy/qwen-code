# `qwen-autofix.yml` — design record

The autofix loop's workflow file carries an unusually dense commentary: every
threshold, every gate, and every fail-closed choice in it was paid for by a
live incident, and the reasoning is worth more than the line it guards. This
file is where that commentary lives.

## Why the prose moved out of the YAML

GitHub **refuses to start runs for a workflow file larger than 500 KB**
(512,000 bytes), and the refusal is silent — there is no annotation, no failed
run, no disabled-workflow banner.

On 2026-08-19 `qwen-autofix.yml` crossed that line (512,782 bytes) and the
loop went dark for a day with a symptom set that reads like an Actions outage
rather than a size limit:

| Trigger                               | Behaviour past the limit                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schedule`                            | stops firing entirely — no run is created at all                                                                   |
| `workflow_dispatch`                   | a run is created and sits `queued` forever with **zero jobs**, uncancellable through the API                       |
| `issues`, `issue_comment`             | silently stop                                                                                                      |
| `pull_request`, `pull_request_review` | **keep working** — these resolve the workflow from the PR's own branch, so an older, smaller copy of the file runs |

That last row is what makes the failure so hard to read: the loop keeps posting
successful runs from PR events while every scheduled scan is dead. Cloning the
file to a new path does not help either — the copy inherits the size.

So: **prose belongs here, long steps belong in `.github/scripts/`.**
`.github/scripts/check-workflow-size.sh` fails CI before the limit can be
reached again.

That gate is a ceiling, and a ceiling only objects once a file is nearly at the
wall — so growth accumulates unremarked until one unlucky PR has to pay for
everyone. This file regained 78 KB in that migration and gave 25 KB of it back
in a single feature commit two days later, with nothing raising a hand. The
same script therefore also enforces a **ratchet**: every workflow's recorded
size lives in `.size-baseline`, and exceeding it by more than the allowance
fails until the number is updated in the same PR. Growing a file is still
allowed — the ratchet only insists the growth be visible in review rather than
discovered at the wall.

The ratchet's blast radius is scoped to the PR that earned it (#9904). The
comparison above is worktree-vs-checked-in-baseline, so a file that grew on
main without the same-PR bump would otherwise fail every unrelated open PR on
a file it never touched — that red-walled the queue twice in two weeks
(#9747, #9822). Given the PR's base commit (`WORKFLOW_SIZE_BASE_SHA`, wired
in `ci.yml`), the gate hard-fails only when the PR's copy of the file differs
from the base; a byte-identical copy means the staleness is main-side drift
and earns a warning pointing at the one-line baseline-bump PR instead. An
unresolvable base keeps the strict failure — the gate fails closed.

### Steps that moved out, not just their prose

`review-address` · `Push and report` was 626 lines of inline shell — ~41 KB,
the third-largest `run:` body in the file after
`Scan for PRs with new feedback` and `Prepare branch and feedback` — and its
body now lives in `.github/scripts/autofix-push-and-report.sh`. The YAML keeps
the step's `if:` and `env:`: when it runs, and what reaches it.

**The file is never executed from disk.** The stage step reads it from the
trusted-base checkout, before any branch code has run, and passes the text
through step output; the step runs those bytes. That is the delivery the inline
block already had — the workflow file's own bytes, chosen by GitHub, not by
anything on the runner — and the one `upsert-deferred-issue.sh` uses.

This matters because `Push and report` holds the PAT and runs _after_ the agent
and the verification gate have executed branch code on this host. A copy staged
under `${RUNNER_TEMP}` would be theirs to swap, which is why the staged scripts
that do live on disk (`resanitize-git-config.sh`, the gate runner) each carry a
digest the invoking step re-checks. Content delivery removes the object those
digests exist to protect: nothing to stage, nothing to digest, nothing to type
check, no second open, and no check→use window between the steps. The
qualifier that makes it hold is that a step output is fixed when its step ends
— later steps read the recorded value, so a disk write after staging cannot
change what arrives here. It is not a claim that the value is unreachable
while the stage step is still running.

`docs/design/autofix-gate-runner-isolation.md` finishes the job: once this step
is its own `publish` job, checking out the trusted base and never executing
branch code, the script can simply be run from the checkout.

## How the pointers work

Where a block of commentary used to sit, the workflow keeps its opening lines
plus a pointer:

```yaml
# Growth brake: measure the PR's net size (insertions minus
# deletions) over this window and ...
# Full rationale → qwen-autofix.md#af-030
```

Each section below is the **verbatim** text of the block that pointer replaced,
titled with the job and step it belongs to. Editing rules: keep the pointer and
the section id in sync, put new long-form reasoning here rather than in the
YAML, and never delete a section without deleting its pointer.

### 1. (top level) — One workflow for the whole autonomous-fix lifecycle:

In `(top level)`.

```text
One workflow for the whole autonomous-fix lifecycle:

  issue → locate → fix → open PR        (issue phase)
  open PR → review → triage → fix → push (review phase)

The lifecycle is asynchronous — a PR is opened in one run and its review is
addressed in a later run once a reviewer has weighed in — so each scheduled
tick runs only the phase(s) that make sense, decided by the `route` job:
  • every 10m            → review phase; issue phase only if no PR needs work
  • issues:labeled        → issue phase when ready label, state, and sender match
  • pull_request_review   → review phase for submitted feedback on bot PRs
                            (open PRs only: reviews on closed/merged PRs
                            drop at the route gate; the scheduled scan is
                            the backstop for anything missed)
  • pull_request:labeled  → maintainer applies autofix/takeover → the loop
                            manages that PR (human-authored included, and
                            maintainer FORKS too: the fork's author must
                            hold write+ live and the PR must allow
                            maintainer edits — the bot then fetches/pushes
                            the fork branch directly; org-owned forks
                            cannot enable allow-edits → adoption instead);
                            unlabeled releases it. autofix/skip opts any PR
                            out everywhere and wins over takeover. Labels
                            need GitHub triage+, so the permission gate is
                            GitHub's own. The bot's OWN fork PRs (author ==
                            the autofix bot, e.g. its codex flow) are auto-
                            managed WITHOUT a label when allow-edits is on —
                            they are the bot's own generated work, trust-
                            equal to an in-repo bot PR; autofix/skip still
                            opts them out.
  • issue_comment         → '@qwen-code /takeover' (apply the label),
                            '@qwen-code /takeover from N' (apply it and
                            seed this window's round counter at N, for a
                            PR that already spent N rounds in review), and
                            '@qwen-code /takeover stop' (remove it) — sugar
                            for people without label access: the PR author,
                            or write+ collaborators. Exact-match constants,
                            and the ONLY side effect is the label toggle;
                            engagement/release still happen exclusively via
                            the label events, so manual labeling and the
                            commands are the same single mechanism.
  • workflow_dispatch     → force a phase, an issue, or a PR

Every GitHub write (issue/PR comments, labels, branch push, PR create) goes
through CI_DEV_BOT_PAT so the bot acts as the configured autofix identity.
PAT label writes can emit issues:labeled events; the route guards below make
those runs exit unless the label, issue state, and ready label all match.

In `run`.

```text
Suggestions may improve a PR, but continuing to implement them after five
change-producing rounds expands the diff and creates fresh review churn.
From round 6 onward, only Critical findings, formally requested changes,
failed checks, and base conflicts may drive code changes; lower-severity
feedback is recorded and left open. Lowered from 10: at 10 the threshold
only ever bound takeover PRs (the strict cap discards a plain PR at round
10 before Critical-only could engage), so long-running managed PRs spent
ten rounds growing their diff on suggestions before the brake applied.
Counted from the window's SEED, not always from zero: '@qwen-code
/takeover from N' starts the window's counter at N so a PR taken over
after N rounds of ordinary review reaches this threshold in the
REMAINDER rather than a fresh five. Without a seed the counter starts at
0 exactly as before, so a PR that spent nine human rounds getting to
"almost mergeable" no longer restarts the suggestion valve at full
travel the moment it is managed. The seed is window-scoped like every
other census: '@qwen-code /retry' or a bare re-takeover opens a window
with no seed and the counter returns to 0 (that IS what re-arming
means), so a late-stage PR is re-seeded by re-issuing the command with
its number. It does NOT seed the GROWTH brake below, which anchors its
baseline at the window's first measured round — a pre-takeover baseline
is not recoverable, so growth is always measured from engagement.
```

<a id="af-003"></a>

### 3. run — Net-diff growth budgets per counting window — the SIZE sibling of the round brake above.…

In `run`.

```text
Net-diff growth budgets per counting window — the SIZE sibling of the
round brake above. CRITICAL_ONLY_AFTER_ROUND counts rounds, but one round
can add hundreds of lines (#8853 grew 315 → 1393 net lines in four bot
rounds, +609 in a single "harden per review feedback" round; #8276 grew
~2700 net lines under management), so a managed PR can bloat drastically
while still under the round threshold — and every window re-arm reopens
the suggestion valve. The first round of a counting window records the
PR's net size (insertions minus deletions vs the merge base) as that
window's baseline; once live growth beyond the baseline exceeds a budget,
Critical-only mode engages early. Everything Critical-only preserves
still flows — Critical findings, Request changes reviews, in-budget
maintainer feedback, failed checks, conflict resolution — only the
suggestion channel stops. `@qwen-code /retry` (or re-engaging takeover)
opens a fresh window and re-anchors the baseline at the current size.
TWO budgets, not one: measured bloat concentrates in TESTS (#8853's
growth was 86% test lines — every round pins ever-more-marginal behavior;
#8276's was 78%), so a single budget is effectively spent by test growth
and cannot be tightened on tests without also strangling source fixes.
Test lines are *.test.*/*.spec.* files, __snapshots__/, __tests__/,
test-utils/, and
integration-tests/ (the pathspec lives in the prepare step); source is
everything else, minus mechanical churn (lockfiles and the regenerated
settings schema) that is skimmed rather than reviewed. Either budget
tripping engages the brake.
TUNABLE WITHOUT A CODE CHANGE like the scan budgets above; a malformed
value falls back to its default at the read site.

In `route`.

```text
The issue_comment clause is a cheap expression-level prefilter: the
overwhelming majority of comments never start a job at all. The real
gates (exact body match, sender authorization) live in 'Decide phases'.
Nuance: a body with LEADING whitespace dies here even though the decide
branch would trim it — fail closed, command must start the comment.
Both commands are prefiltered here (/takeover toggles the label, /retry
re-arms a stranded PR); everything else never starts a job.
The pull_request_review clause drops reviews on closed/merged PRs at the
gate: a PR that can no longer receive commits has nothing to address.
Finding-reply bursts on just-merged PRs otherwise start one no-op run
per reply (observed 2026-08-16: 24+ reply reviews on merged #9222 and
26 runs on merged #9189 within minutes — issue #9296). The fleet never
loses a legitimate target from this: the schedule scan engages any open
PR with review context on its next tick, and address-time revalidation
already drops targets whose PR closed after dispatch.
```

### 5. route — Concurrency is keyed by TARGET, not shared and not fully unique:

In `route`.

```text
Concurrency is keyed by TARGET, not shared and not fully unique:
  • cron ticks share one group (a newer tick supersedes a queued one)
  • review events coalesce PER PR (two reviews on the same PR seconds
    apart route once — the old shared group's one useful side effect,
    kept, without letting events on OTHER PRs cancel this one)
  • issue events coalesce PER issue
  • dispatches are unique per run and are never cancelled —
    fork-bridge dispatches included: `source` is a public
    workflow_dispatch input, so no dispatch may claim a trusted
    per-PR coalescing group by asserting an origin; fork-review
    bursts coalesce upstream instead (the signal per PR, the bridge
    per conclusion+head)
The old single shared cancel-in-progress group let ANY newer event kill
pending full scans while route jobs sat queued behind runner backlog —
observed as hours of scan starvation during review-event storms.
Five cases: schedule → one shared cron group (newer tick supersedes);
pull_request_review → per-PR, but ONLY when the review payload
already looks trusted (the group is entered before any step runs, so
an arbitrary commenter's review would otherwise cancel a queued
legitimate route and then die in 'Decide phases' — untrusted payloads
get a run-unique group and still face the real permission gate
inside; the association literal mirrors TRUSTED_ASSOC and the login
mirrors REVIEW_BOT); pull_request label events → per-PR (GitHub only
lets triage+ apply labels, so the whole event class is trusted —
in their OWN per-PR group (label-{N}), distinct from the review
group so a simultaneous review and label toggle on the same PR can
never cancel each other, and only the takeover label routes at all
(unrelated labels are filtered at the job gate); issue_comment → its own per-PR command group, but
ONLY when the commenter's payload association already looks trusted
(same prefilter pattern as reviews — an untrusted commenter must not
cancel a maintainer's queued command; untrusted payloads get a
run-unique group and still face the real permission gate inside), so
a burst of trusted command comments coalesces to at most two runs
with latest-intent semantics, never touching review routes;
issues → per-issue; anything else (dispatch) → unique per run_id,
never cancelled. A fork-bridge dispatch is still a dispatch here:
`source` is a public input any manual dispatch can set, so keying a
cancellable per-PR group on it would let a manual dispatch cancel a
queued one (and vice versa).

In `route` · `Decide phases`.

```text
Fork PR — decline, and say so. This event carries NO
repository secrets: GitHub withholds them from every run
tied to a pull request whose head lives in a fork, and the
run header states it outright (`Secret source: None`). So
CI_DEV_BOT_PAT arrives EMPTY and neither review-scan nor
review-address could authenticate from here — the earlier
claim that "this event runs in BASE-repo context" held for
the workflow FILE, which is read from base, but not for the
credentials.
Admitting the PR anyway spent two API reads to decide it,
then three more failing inside the scan, which exited 1 on
`metadata_fetch_failed` — a reason whose blocked comment
promises "a later scheduled scan will retry", true for a
5xx and false for a credential this run was never handed.
Every review of a fork PR reddened the workflow while
changing nothing, and that noise buried the failures that
do need a human.
The label and the feedback both keep working: the scheduled
scan runs in repo context and admits fork takeover PRs on
its own. This mirrors the pull_request label branch below,
which already declines forks for exactly this reason.

```text
'<cmd> from N' — the ONE parameterized form, and the only
place this workflow reads a value out of a comment body.
Kept inside the constants discipline above: the literal
prefix must still match TAKEOVER_COMMAND byte-for-byte, the
tail is a bounded integer, and the captured value only ever
reaches an integer comparison and a printf '%s' of a
re-validated number — never an unquoted shell word, a jq
program, or an API path. Seeds the round counter so a PR
that already burned N review rounds before takeover reaches
CRITICAL_ONLY_AFTER_ROUND after the remainder rather than a
full fresh five. 1..99: a seed at or past the effective cap
is clamped at the read sites, but rejecting 3-digit input
here keeps the obvious typo out entirely.

In `issue-autofix`.

```text
Secret-bearing and executes agent-driven code, but the agent runs inside
the docker sandbox image and only ever writes a new branch as the
dev-bot — it never executes a foreign author's code. Forks of this repo
(and MAINTAINER_ECS_RUNNER_DISABLED) fall back to hosted. On
pull_request / pull_request_review events the ECS route additionally
needs a same-repo head or a write+ author (ci.yml's pick_runner form);
the other triggers skip that clause and rely on their own gates
instead: issues / schedule require autofix/approved plus
status/ready-for-agent on the issue, and workflow_dispatch rides the
actor's own write access. Docker availability on this pool is proven
in-repo by qwen-triage's container jobs, which run on the same
runner labels.

In `issue-autofix`.

```text
route.issue_number is only set for forced dispatches; label events carry
the issue in the payload, and scan-and-pick runs (cron, unforced
dispatch) share one 'scheduled' group. The old github.run_id fallback
made every scan-and-pick run its own group, so two overlapping scans
(cron fires every 40-70min, this job runs up to 180) could double-claim
the same issue — the claim recheck runs after assess and only narrows
the race to the short gap between the recheck and the claim's label
write; it does not close it. Queued (never cancelled) so the newest
pending tick still runs after a long scan if targets remain;
intermediate ticks are superseded, which is fine because each run
rescans from scratch.

GitHub evaluates concurrency before the job `if`, but after `needs`, so
the group is gated on the same runnability predicate as the `if` above,
plus a dry-run exclusion: runs whose issue phase will not execute
(do_issue=false takeover, review, and command events; label events
failing the decide gates; scheduled ticks whose review-scan still has
targets) and dry runs (if-runnable, but their Claim/Publish steps are
gated off) get a run-unique group instead — a run that never claims
entering a target-keyed group would replace the single pending run
there and silently cancel it. Same precedent as qwen-triage.yml's
triage/tmux jobs.

Duplicated verbatim in 3 places: `issue-autofix` · `Sanitize workspace git config`, `build-cli` · `Sanitize workspace git config`, `review-address` · `Sanitize workspace git config`.

```text
The runner USER's global config is the same exec surface as the
workspace config below: pool jobs run human-authored code (branch
tests) as this user, and a stray `git config --global` outlives
the job on the persistent pool. Measured: run 31516789251 found
diff.external=global-driver in ~/.gitconfig, failing per-hunk
probe tests in every later verification gate on this host. The
gates read a throwaway global config now, so this scrub is host
hygiene plus protection for THIS job's PAT-bearing git steps,
which do read the real file. It runs BEFORE the .git early-exit:
host hygiene owes nothing to the workspace existing. Denylist
here, not the local allowlist below: the file belongs to the
pool image, so routing/credential keys (http.*, url.*,
credential.*) may be deliberate infra and are left alone — only
the command-execution families go, plus include/includeIf (which
can pull any of them back in) and protocol.ext.allow (which arms
the command-executing ext:: transport a kept url.insteadOf could
redirect to). Two ROUTING exceptions ride the denylist because
each defeats the PAT steps directly: url.*.insteadOf/
pushInsteadOf (rewrites the push/fetch URL at transport time —
the rest of url.* stays) and http.*.sslVerify/sslCAInfo (turns
a kept http.proxy into a TLS-terminating interceptor; the pool
works on the default CA today, so scrubbing these can only
fail loudly, never silently). Subsection slots are `.+`, never
`[^.]+`: git subsection names may contain dots (`[diff "a.b"]
command` flattens to diff.a.b.command and would slip past
`[^.]+`); overmatching is harmless in a denylist. Guarded
`|| true` twice: no global file and no match are both normal,
and either would kill the step under the default `bash -e` +
pipefail otherwise. The same denylist lives in
resanitize-git-config.sh, which the PAT-bearing steps re-run
AFTER branch code executed on the host; the workflow contract
tests pin every copy byte-identical — edit them together.
The GLOBAL scope spans TWO files — ~/.gitconfig and
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/git/config — but with both
present, `git config --global` lists and unsets ONLY
~/.gitconfig (probed on git 2.43 and 2.55: the listing omits
the XDG keys and --unset-all exits 5 with them live), so sweep
each file explicitly by pointing GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL at it — the
env var replaces the whole global scope with exactly that
file, for reads and writes alike.

Duplicated verbatim in 2 places: `issue-autofix` · `Remove stale sandbox containers`, `review-address` · `Remove stale sandbox containers`.

```text
run-agent.mjs's budget kill removes the container it launched,
but a JOB timeout still reaps only the HOST-side docker client,
not the container: a killed sandbox can keep running on this
persistent runner. Observed directly — a hung leg's container
name counter found qwen-code-0.21.8-0 already occupied and
picked -1. But the docker DAEMON is per host while this pool
runs several runner registrations on one OS, so a RUNNING
qwen-code-* container can belong to a job executing on another
registration of this same host — reaping it would destroy a
live sandbox mid-run. Reap only provably-dead containers
(exited/dead), before the sandbox picks a name (and before the
leftovers can wedge the daemon). Every docker call here is
tolerated: this step is hygiene, and a daemon blip, a racing
reap on another registration, or a container that refuses
removal must not kill the round at setup. Every call also runs
under `timeout` (GNU coreutils on the ubuntu runners): a daemon
that is alive but wedged blocks `docker ps` indefinitely, and
`|| STALE=''` catches only a nonzero exit, not a hang — the
step would sit until the job timeout, a silent round
reintroduced ahead of the very idle watchdog this PR adds.

```text
No remote npm cache on the persistent pool: one measured
review-address leg spent 339s in `Set up Node.js` restoring
2,654,052,865 bytes (~10 MB/s) to protect an `npm ci` that took
29s in the very next step, and those runners keep ~/.npm across
jobs anyway, so every leg paid the download again — up to ten
review-address legs per scan. The hosted fallback is ephemeral
and keeps the cache; the choice keys on the runner fact directly.
Keep the truthy literal in the MIDDLE of the ternary — GHA's
&&/|| return operand values and '' is falsy, so
`== 'self-hosted' && '' || 'npm'` yields 'npm' on BOTH pools
(the contract tests evaluate the expression for both runner
facts). package-manager-cache stops a future `packageManager`
field in package.json from silently re-enabling the cache here.

--changed follows the import graph so transitive breakage is caught.
Full regression is covered by regular CI on the PR after the push.
Map each changed file to its OWNING npm workspace via the trusted
staged resolver, shared with the other verify gate so both resolve
packages identically. It expands the on-disk root package.json
workspaces globs (so a workspace the branch ADDS is included) and
takes each file's longest-prefix workspace — never a flat
'packages/<dir>' (ENOENT-crashes on nested packages) nor a fixture
package.json inside a workspace's src tree (would skip the owning
workspace's tests). No '|| true': a resolver error (missing node, an
unreadable manifest) must fail the gate loudly rather than silently
skip package tests; legitimate no-match input already exits 0 empty.

In `issue-autofix` · `Publish PR`.

```text
Take this PAT-bearing step off every mutable host git surface —
both the shared config FILES and git's ENV channels — keep this
block byte-identical to its twin in 'Push and report' (the
contract test pins them equal). File scopes: the pool shares one
HOME across ~27 runner registrations and review-address fans out
max-parallel, so a concurrent job can rewrite ~/.gitconfig inside
this step's sweep->push window (a URL-scoped sslVerify=false there
overrides the -c pin below over real TLS); redirect global/system
to a per-run throwaway (as the gates do) so the push reads neither.
Env channels: branch code in an earlier step of THIS job can inject
env through $GITHUB_ENV, and several channels OUTRANK file config or
bypass it entirely — pin PATH to the staged trusted value and drop
LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT/LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (else a swapped
git/sha256sum/bash defeats the digest gate below), then strip
GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/_PARAMETERS (command-line-precedence config),
GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL (env twin of protocol.allow — arms ext::),
GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY/GIT_SSL_CAINFO (override the sslVerify pin over
real TLS), GIT_PROXY_COMMAND, GIT_EXEC_PATH (transport-helper
binary), GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE/GIT_COMMON_DIR/GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY/
GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES/GIT_SHALLOW_FILE (repoint the repo
git reads and pushes), GIT_ASKPASS/GIT_SSH/GIT_SSH_COMMAND
(credential/exec hijack). The throwaway global uses an
unpredictable mktemp path so a same-user watcher cannot re-plant
http.proxy/sslCAInfo into a fixed literal after the seed. All
probe-verified in the #8961 review.

Authenticate the push with a one-shot, host-scoped credential
helper via `git -c`: nothing is written to the reused
workspace's .git/config (no error path can strand it there),
argv holds only the literal ${GITHUB_TOKEN} reference, and the
host scope means it cannot answer a non-GitHub URL. The leading
empty credential.helper RESETS the inherited helper list first:
helpers run in config order and the first to answer wins, so a
helper planted at any earlier scope would otherwise see the
request (and the env) before ours answers — probe-verified in
the #8961 review. http.sslVerify pins the transport: a kept
http.proxy plus a planted sslVerify=false would otherwise let
an interceptor read the credential off the wire.

```text
The round seed rides as its OWN marker on a separate line, NEVER as
a field inside '<!-- takeover-ack engaged -->'. That literal is
matched with jq `contains()` — closing '-->' included — at seven
read sites: four here (the ack dedup, the scan's first-pickup
dedup, and the two REARM_KEY window readers) and three in
qwen-fleet-shepherd.yml (the paused/resume detector). Appending a
field would silently break all seven: the window key would fall
back to an OLDER engage ack, so the round counter would read a dead
window, and the shepherd would stop seeing the engage as a resume
signal and age out a PR that was just re-armed. Same reasoning, and
the same shape, as the autofix-redcheck marker.

Already managed: repeating the command is the ROUND-COUNTER
RESET. A fresh engage ack starts a new counting window (only
markers newer than the latest ack count toward the cap), so
a PR that exhausted its rounds continues under management —
no label churn needed. The watermark is untouched: feedback
already addressed is never replayed.
Body built ONCE so the retry posts byte-identical text.
Same one-retry shape as the engage post below — the seed
marker's only copy rides in this body too — but the final
fallback is LOUD: nothing heals a missing re-arm (the scan
heals only engage-less PRs, and the pre-existing engage ack
suppresses the dedup), and a 're-armed' claim plus the
stale-escalation cleanup must not follow a window reset that
never landed (R7-7).

the same on every runner image.
Idempotent create first, with the label's real color: the
REST add would silently create a missing label with a RANDOM
color (gh pr edit failed loud there), and this was the one

```text
REST for the same reason as the add above; the label name is a
path segment and contains a slash, so it must be URI-encoded.
A concurrent removal between the presence check and this
DELETE already reached the end state — the 404 must not abort
the step and drop the release ack below. Other failures (403,
5xx, network) also must not drop the ack — a later
`/takeover stop` retries the removal — but must not disappear
silently either: masked, the ack reads "released" while the
loop keeps managing the PR.
The 404-tolerance block is pinned byte-identical to the other
workflows' label DELETE (a contract test), so REMOVED_OK —
whether the takeover release actually LANDED — is derived
AFTER the idiom from the captured stream: gh api prints the
remaining-labels JSON body on success (even '[]'), while a
failure carries "HTTP <status>" in the error text. 404 =
already off (landed); any other HTTP error = the release did
NOT land and the needs-human removal below must NOT run
(R4-32) — or the PR keeps the takeover label (still capped,
nothing manages it now) while losing the only filterable
escalation state. The flag is keyed on the EXIT STATUS, with
one text-derived exception: a failed DELETE whose error
carries the exact "HTTP 404" token is the already-off case.
The match must stay that precise token, not a bare "404"
substring: transport failures embed the request URL — a PR
number containing 404 would flip the classification — while
no transport error carries an "HTTP" token (R6-1/R6-19).

===========================================================================
TAKEOVER ACK — visible confirmation when a maintainer engages or releases
a PR via the takeover label. Manual label toggles are explicit user
actions, so every one acks (no dedup wanted). Command-driven toggles are
acked by takeover-command itself in BOTH directions — the label event has
been observed to not fire at all (#7999, #8002), so those acks cannot
depend on this round-trip — and the route suppresses this job for them
(label sender is the bot). In-repo PRs only reach this job.
===========================================================================
Re-arm a stranded PR without deleting anything. Recovery previously meant
`gh api -X DELETE` on the bot's own autofix-eval marker comment: raw API
access, an erased audit trail, and undiscoverable unless you had read the
workflow. This posts ONE marker instead — the scan then re-reads the
feedback (the marker releases the watermark those older markers held) and
the round counter resets, because the marker also opens a fresh counting
window exactly like an engage ack.

In `takeover-ack` · `Acknowledge takeover state change`.

```text
Bilingual with COLLAPSED Chinese (project convention), built via
printf so no workflow indentation leaks into the markdown (4+
leading spaces would render the marker line as a code block).
Live label/author state decides WHAT to acknowledge: a skip label
vetoes the engagement (skip wins — no engaged anchor for
management the scans refuse), and a release on a BOT-authored PR
must not claim disengagement — standard bot management continues,
only takeover mode (raised cap) ends.
Fail CLOSED like the sibling takeover-command job: empty metadata
here would default HAS_SKIP to false and post a wrong "engaged"
ack on a skip-labeled PR during a transient API failure. A red
ack job posts nothing — engagement itself is scan-driven and
unaffected.
A base refusal needs no live state — it is decided entirely by the
route — so it does NOT ride on this read. Making the one ack whose
whole purpose is "say why nothing happened" depend on an unrelated
API call would reintroduce the silence it exists to remove.

'none' and HTTP 404 are DEFINITIVE answers, not lookup failures.
GitHub returns 200 with permission 'none' for logins that exist but
hold nothing here (bot-type logins such as dependabot[bot], and org
logins), and 404 for logins that do not exist or are empty. Both
mean "no write access" — the routine rejection this gate is for.
Retrying them would burn 3 API calls plus back-off per candidate per
scheduled tick, forever, and strand the caller on
'permission_lookup_failed': a red forced run (exit 1) whose blocked
comment promises "a later scheduled scan will retry" — a retry that
can never succeed — while the actionable "grant the fork author
write access" guidance behind author_permission_* stays unreachable.
Only genuinely transient answers (5xx, network, auth) retry.

In `review-scan` · `Scan for PRs with new feedback`.

```text
Same filter as the sibling upsert in 'Post autofix status comment',
including its two guards: `// ""` so a single comment with a null
body cannot abort the whole program (jq exits 5, all three
attempts fail, and the run reds out WITHOUT posting the very
status it exists to post), and --arg so a repo-configured
AUTOFIX_BOT_LOGIN containing " or \ is a mismatch instead of a jq
parse error. Stays an inline id stream into `tail -1` — it never
lands in a WORKDIR json file, so the WORKDIR page normalizer
(add-with-empty-default) must NOT be applied here: it would wrap
the id stream in an array and break the tail-1 consumer.
pipefail is set LOCALLY here rather than relied on: this `if`
must test gh's status, not jq's. A gh failure carrying an HTTP
status prints the error body to stdout, so jq errors out and the
retry fires — but a CONNECTION-level failure (TCP reset, TLS
abort, DNS blip) leaves stdout EMPTY, and `jq -rs` then prints
nothing and exits 0. Without pipefail that reads as success on
nothing read: status_lookup_ok=true, the empty id takes the
writer down the "no status comment yet" branch, and it posts a
DUPLICATE ⛔ blocked comment beside the stale ✅ one — the exact
two-status state this function exists to prevent — on a green
run. `defaults.run.shell: bash` already gives every step in this
file `-eo pipefail`, so this is redundant today; it is also the
only guard that survives that default changing or this helper
being lifted into a step that sets its own options.

FORK PRs are admitted per candidate: the author must hold write+
RIGHT NOW (the same live-privilege rule as the comment command)
and the PR must allow maintainer edits (or the bot cannot push).
Two sources, unioned: takeover-LABELED forks (any eligible author,
explicit opt-in) AND the bot's OWN forks (bot-prs.json is
--author AUTOFIX_BOT) — a fork the bot itself opened is its own
generated work, trust-equal to an in-repo bot PR, so it needs no
label (autofix/skip still opts it out). Rare set — one permission
call each; the write+ check below still gates every candidate.

anti-starvation rotation, which only bites once in-repo
candidates alone exhaust the inspection budget.

```text
Base of the auto-update-stale-base decision below. A PR can be red
purely because it merged a main that was BROKEN at the time and has
since been FIXED — observed repeatedly (a web-shell TS break, an
agent-registry test) stranding healthy PRs on a failure that has
nothing to do with them. GitHub's "Update branch" merges current
main in and re-runs CI, which clears it. We do that automatically
only when the SAME failing check also passed for the PR that produced
current main (MAIN_GREEN_CHECKS) — a necessary-but-NOT-sufficient
signal, NOT proof that main is healthy.

MAIN_GREEN_CHECKS is sourced from the last-merged PR's PRE-MERGE
check-runs, which ran against that PR merged with main-as-of-then —
never the tree now on main. (ci.yml's post-merge push lane DOES put
check-runs on main's squash commits now, but that lane is lint, static
analysis and unit tests only — the no-AK integration gate and every
platform lane stay off the push trigger — so it is a strictly narrower
signal than a PR's full matrix, and this deliberately stays on the
pre-merge runs.) main breaks here by
SEMANTIC CONFLICT: two PRs green apart but broken together. In exactly
that state the last-merged PR is green, this signal reads green, and
the update would merge a currently-broken main into a healthy PR. The
signal also inherits the last PR's matrix shape (a SKIPPED platform
job is absent, so a PR stranded on it is never unstuck — fail-safe,
but non-deterministic). The blast radius stays recoverable, not zero:
the merge (not rebase) is revertible, a marker bounds re-updates to
once per 2h, and the CAS (expected_head_sha) rejects a concurrent
push. A re-enabled merge queue would let us source this from a
genuinely validated merged tree instead: ci.yml DOES have a
merge_group trigger, so a merged tree's check-runs would land where
we could read them.

Fetch main's head and that check-name set ONCE per scan: resolve
main's head to the PR that produced it and read check-runs from that
PR's head SHA.

```text
PRs whose review-address is already RUNNING OR QUEUED in any live
autofix run must not be re-targeted. Schedule/dispatch runs execute
against main's SHA, so their matrix jobs never appear in the PR's
statusCheckRollup — and a fanned-out matrix holds queued jobs well
past a 10-minute tick, so without this the next scan re-emits the
same PRs and the per-PR address groups accumulate duplicates that
later replay stale watermarks. The status filter is SERVER-side: a
client-side filter over the N newest runs loses a long-lived
fanned-out run once cron traffic pushes it past the window, and
its queued PRs silently stop looking busy. The union covers THREE
statuses — in_progress, queued, AND pending: GitHub reports a run
'pending' while its remaining jobs wait on concurrency groups
(neither 'queued' nor 'in_progress'), and the run-level status
trails the job-level flip by minutes, so the two-status union
loses legs that are already running. Measured 2026-08-21 (#9596):
a run whose four legs had been running for several minutes still
listed 'pending', the scan re-dispatched all four, and every
duplicate burned one build-cli (~5 min) before queueing behind
the per-PR group it should have skipped. Pending runs cost one
extra jobs-view each and match nothing until their matrix
materialises. Filtered this way the limit applies to LIVE runs
only (at most a handful), and one jobs-view per live run stays
cheap. The enumeration calls the runs API directly, not `gh run
list --status`: gh validates --status against a client-side
allow-list that only accepts 'pending' from 2.65.0 onward, while
the self-hosted ecs-qwen pool (already used by the issue-autofix,
build-cli, and review-address sibling jobs) lags the hosted
images — an older gh exits 1 on the flag and FAIL-CLOSED below
then silently empties every scan. The API's status filter is
server-side on every gh version.

FAIL-CLOSED: any enumeration failure (the run list, or one run's
jobs view) empties THIS scan's candidate set. Measured 2026-08-16
(#9296): silently swallowing these errors re-dispatched PRs whose
legs had been running or queued for 3-12 minutes; each duplicate
burned one build-cli (~5 min) before cancelling a queued sibling
leg through the per-PR group's latest-wins queue. A duplicate
costs far more than one skipped scan — the next tick re-inspects
with fresh reads. Only an EXPLICIT dispatch (workflow_dispatch
with a PR number) keeps its override semantics and is NOT emptied
by an enumeration failure — FORCED_PR is ALSO set for trusted
pull_request_review scans, which are not explicit dispatches. The
step also emits enum_failed: the scan exits 0, and an emptied set
would otherwise read exactly like "no PR needs work" and flip the
scheduled issue phase ON against its declared ordering. The
dispatch-pending status check below additionally covers the
window where the leg does not exist yet (behind build-cli).

```text
Idle backoff, from the list's own updatedAt (no API call): a
candidate with no activity for >24h is inspected on about one
scan in four instead of every one. The pool doubled in two
days (28 takeover PRs, 8 of them idle in "nothing new" state
for 10+ hours), and every idle inspection costs a unit of the
SHARED MAX_CANDIDATE_INSPECTIONS budget plus a slice of the
serial API walk over the candidate list. The win is small: a
few fewer gh round-trips per scan (~2-3 of the pool) and less
rate-limit pressure. It does NOT recover the job's queue or
startup latency, which dwarfed the walk in the #8002
measurement that motivated this. Idle PRs never reach the
10-target budget (the "nothing new" branch continues before
the TARGETS append), so that cap is NOT what this relieves.
Safe because comments, reviews, labels, and pushes all bump
updatedAt or route in real time; the two scan-only signals
that do NOT bump it — a base conflict appearing when main
moves, and still-red checks awaiting the redcheck marker —
wait out the backoff on a PR nobody touched in a day, then
self-correct (the eventual address run comments/pushes). The
slot is keyed by PR number mod 4 against a 600s time quantum
(same quantum as ROT_OFF), so each scan is an independent
~25% draw per idle PR — about one scan in four. This is NOT a
bounded gap: the scheduled scan lands every ~40-70 min on
this repo (not the */10 the cron implies), so the wait is
geometric — measured median ~2h, p90 ~6h across 100 real
scans. The forced-dispatch path never builds the list files,
so a forced PR is always inspected (fail-open, like a PR
missing from the set).

```text
Review-in-flight gate (#8888): NON_BLOCKING_CHECKS keeps an
in-flight review-pr from blocking the FEEDBACK gate (its
conclusion carries nothing the loop acts on — #7416), but every
head mutation this scan can make (a stale-base update-branch,
infra rerun, or address push later) is a synchronize event that
cancels the in-flight review via qwen-code-pr-review.yml's
cancel-in-progress, discarding up to ~3h of review work — the
self-reinforcing cancellation loop of #8830 (three killed runs
in one PR, two by merge-main). Its findings are also the very
feedback the next round should batch with, so deferring the
WHOLE round until the review lands loses nothing: the watermark
is not advanced on a skip, so the feedback stays visible. This
is deliberately SEPARATE from HAS_PENDING_CHECKS rather than a
NON_BLOCKING_CHECKS revert: that gate ages checks out after
PENDING_STALE_MIN and would also re-block on the review's
conclusion, reintroducing #7416's median-49-minute wait.

First-pickup engage ack: fork label events carry no secrets and

engage ack yet gets one here (identity-verified) — it is also
the round-window anchor. ic.json is re-fetched so THIS scan
already counts under the fresh key. ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING:
ic.json for THIS candidate is fetched just above — reading a
previous candidate's file would mis-dedup (spurious re-ack →
window reset every scan), and a missing file would kill the
whole scan step under -eo pipefail. Dedup is author-filtered
(a forged human marker must not suppress the real ack), and a
label application NEWER than the latest bot ack means a fresh
engagement — post a fresh ack so the round window and cap
reset as documented (re-arm), which no ack job can do for
forks.

a SHORT grace covers the write's own latency and an
ic.json snapshot taken between the label write and the ack
landing; past it, the command's post failed and the next
scheduled scan heals it (≤10 min), instead of waiting on
a label event that may never arrive. A human-applied

```text
A FORCED dispatch refused here answers OUT LOUD. Observed on
#7836: the fleet shepherd detected a merge conflict, posted
"dispatched the autofix loop to resolve it", and the dispatch
died right here with only the log line above — the PR page
showed a promise, the run showed green, and the conflict sat
unhandled for hours. The shepherd also dedups per head SHA,
and a capped PR gets no pushes, so its head never changes:
silence here freezes conflict handling until a human notices
by accident. Gate on workflow_dispatch — that is the explicit
dispatch lever (the shepherd's `gh workflow run` or a human).
FORCED_PR is ALSO set for every trusted pull_request_review
(route emits pr_number for those), which is not an explicit
dispatch: answering each one here spammed 7 refusals on
#7836, so review submissions stay covered by the
once-per-window pause notice below. No dedup on the dispatch
itself: the shepherd sends at most one per head, and a human
asking twice deserves two answers. fork-bridge dispatches are
the one dispatch-shaped exception: they are fork-PR reviews
laundered into dispatch form (a fork's review event carries no
secrets), not an explicit human/shepherd dispatch — answering
each one loudly would post one refusal per review on a capped
fork PR, the exact #7836 spam this gate exists to prevent.
But `source` is a public workflow_dispatch input any manual
dispatch can set, so the silence is honored ONLY on positive
proof of origin: a recent SUCCESSFUL fork-bridge run whose
title names this exact PR (the bridge propagates the signal's
run-name into its own title — both base-branch files, not
fork-forgeable). The window is generous because route backlog
can queue a dispatch for hours; the PR match, not the window,
is what proves origin. Unverified → answered like any
explicit dispatch.

re-arming opens a fresh window and, if the cap is hit again,

Release evidence = a takeover unlabeled EVENT at-or-newer
than the window key. GitHub records it whenever the label
comes off — `/takeover stop`, the ack job, or a manual UI
removal — unlike the release-ack COMMENT, which both release
paths tolerate losing (R4-1): the stop branch swallows a
failed ack post, and the ack job's set -e aborts before it.
A re-arm advances REARM_KEY past the event, re-enabling the
label. Same-second ties resolve toward "released" — never
re-escalate a completed release (R5-9). Fail closed: an
unreadable event history suppresses the re-label rather than
risk the ping-pong.
A capped takeover candidate already paid for this paginated
endpoint earlier in the same iteration (pr-events.json,
gated by PR_EVENTS_OK) — reuse that fetch instead of paying
it twice per capped takeover PR per scan. Non-takeover
candidates keep the standalone fetch, and the fail-closed
semantics ride the flag: the engage-side '[]' fallback must
never read here as "no releases".

A red check is a persistent STATE, not the instant it turned red.
Counting only "failed since the watermark" made a still-failing PR
invisible the moment the watermark passed the failure: measured on
#6451 (3 reds, all completed 09:30-09:51, watermark 10:55),
#7357 (red 07:59, watermark 09:18) and #7390 (red and watermark
both 11:27:37, so a strict `>` hid it the instant it appeared) —
all three sat red for hours while every scan logged "nothing new".

So: a currently-red check counts as feedback until the head it ran
against has been evaluated. The address job records the head it
reported on; a PR whose recorded head still matches is left alone,
which bounds this to ONE look per head instead of every scan.
Empty LIVE_HEAD → N_RED_NOW stays 0: fail-closed (no head → cannot judge → do not act),
unlike the recording side where an empty REPORT_HEAD keeps reds visible.

older PRs for hours when cron ticks were sparse). The budget

copy_bundle_assets.js already gathers every runtime asset (chunks,

packages/*/dist would triple the artifact size without ever being
read by the legs — the verify gate's full `npm run build` wipes and
rebuilds each package's dist from branch sources (build_package.js
rms it first, so no staleness leaks through). packages/core/dist is
the exception: the settings-schema check runs BEFORE any build (on
every path, including no-action), and its generator — tsx run from
the repo root, whose tsconfig has NO `paths` — imports cli sources
that resolve '@qwen-code/qwen-code-core' through the workspace
symlink to core's dist entry point. Without it the generator crashes
with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND and the gate misreports a deterministic
"settings schema is stale" rejection. The i18n check needs no dist:
it runs with cwd packages/cli, whose tsconfig `paths` map the

Secret-bearing and executes PR code, but every target is live-gated to

author-permission gate by design, not a head-repository gate: takeover
engages maintainer fork PRs, and the pattern matches qwen-code-pr-review,
whose ECS-routed review job also rides its upstream write+ check. The
job therefore runs host-side (no `container:`): the branch code it
executes is collaborator-authored — the same trust class ci.yml's
pick_runner routes onto this pool — and persistent-workspace residue is
scrubbed by the hygiene steps below. On pull_request /
pull_request_review events the ECS route additionally needs a same-repo
head or a write+ author (ci.yml's pick_runner form); issue_comment and
the other triggers skip that clause and rely on the live write+ gates.
Forks of this repo (and MAINTAINER_ECS_RUNNER_DISABLED) fall back to
hosted. Docker availability on this pool is proven in-repo by
qwen-triage's container jobs, which run on the same runner labels.

Simultaneity bound for the whole fleet — the ONLY place different PRs

budget are both far from binding at the current pool size).
Measured at 3, on the scan that selected 7 PRs: the legs started
3-at-a-time and each new one began 3-4s after a slot freed, so the
7th PR waited 81 minutes for a slot it could have had immediately.
5 halved that tail — the point of the cap is that a backlog cannot
open an unbounded number of agent runs at once, not the specific
number.

Verified on a live runner that `max-parallel` accepts this expression
and schedules by it — a 6-leg matrix at 3 started 3, then began the
4th only once a slot freed.
Why 20: 37 PRs carried the label on 2026-08-08, so 5 slots served
~14% of them at a time and the tail measured at 3 simply reappeared
at a larger scale. The ecs-qwen fleet is 84 runners, so 20 concurrent
legs occupy under a quarter of it, and the executed legs sampled that
day finished in 3-28 minutes.
The 300-minute job cap puts the worst case at 5 runner-hours per slot
(100 across the fleet at 20) and holds the per-PR head-write
concurrency group for the same window. Different PRs never share that
group, so raising this does not add push contention.
RAISE BOTH TOGETHER: this must stay strictly below
MAX_TARGETS_PER_SCAN, or the scan cannot emit enough legs to fill the
matrix and the extra slots sit idle. A test pins that for the
fallbacks; for the variables it is an operator invariant.

### 40. review-address — Serialises every writer of THIS PR's head branch, across workflows.

```text
Serialises every writer of THIS PR's head branch, across workflows.
GitHub concurrency groups are repository-scoped, so sharing one name with
qwen-code-pr-review.yml's resolve-pr job is what makes the two mutually
exclusive — a per-workflow name only guards against itself.
Without this, a `@qwen-code /resolve` and this job's own conflict path
both merge the base branch and both push. Observed on #7355: /resolve
pushed at 03:51, this job pushed at 04:05 and was rejected `fetch first`,
discarding a full agent run and leaving no marker to show for it.
Serialising is strictly better than racing: this job fetches the head by
NAME at job start, so the second run reads the winner's result instead of
a stale base — its work is usable and its push lands, rather than being
rejected and thrown away. It may still spend an agent run: the
address-time recheck re-verifies lifecycle and consent (state, labels,
author, base, head branch) but not whether the conflict is still there.
The prefix is a LITERAL on both sides: job-level `concurrency` cannot read
the `env` context, so the two files cannot share a constant. A test pins
them equal instead, because a rename in one file alone silently unlocks
the race again with nothing failing.

```text
SECURITY: checkout trusted base code first. The PR branch is checked
out later in "Prepare branch and feedback" after the trusted CLI
bundle (built once from this base in build-cli) is in place. Without
this pin, pull_request_review events would check out the PR merge ref
by default, letting PR-controlled code influence the secret-bearing
address run. The ref is pinned to the SHA build-cli compiled — not
the live default branch — so a mid-run base push can never leave a
leg running a bundle built from DIFFERENT sources than its checkout.
The SHA is validated fail-loud FIRST: actions/checkout resolves an
empty ref to the event default — on pull_request_review triggers the
PR merge ref — so a broken build-cli output must fail this leg
instead of silently unpinning it.

Live-watermark revalidation: two near-simultaneous triggers for the
SAME PR can both pass their (per-target, route-level) gates and both
scan before either has emitted a matrix job, so both emit this PR
with the same stale watermark. The per-PR address concurrency group
QUEUES the duplicate rather than discarding it — but that queueing
is exactly what makes this check sound: address jobs for one PR run
strictly one at a time, so by the time the duplicate runs here, the
first job's eval marker is posted and visible. Three duplicate
signatures: (a) a sibling evaluated through a NEWER live ts than
our matrix watermark; (b) a conflict-only sibling resolved and
marked at the SAME ts — with no newer feedback its marker keeps
ts=watermark while its ROUND advances past ours (ours is the max
round observed at scan time); (c) a no-op sibling judged THIS exact
head (its redcheck marker matches CHECKED_OUT_HEAD) while keeping
BOTH ts and round unchanged — neither (a) nor (b) fires, but
re-running would post a duplicate report for the same head. Either
way, if there is no live conflict left and nothing newer than the
live watermark, this run is a stale duplicate and discards itself.

```text
Growth brake: measure the PR's net size (insertions minus
deletions vs the merge base), split into test lines and source
lines, and compare against the sizes recorded when this counting
window opened. The baseline rides in the window's first pushed or
no-op report comment as its OWN marker (the autofix-redcheck
pattern — the positional autofix-eval parsers never change), so a
/retry or takeover re-engage re-anchors it with the window.
First-wins on read: a duplicate marker in one window cannot move
an anchored baseline. A handoff round writes no baseline; nothing
was pushed, so the next round re-measures the same size.
Growth-triggered Critical-only reuses the round brake's entire
deferral machinery below; the human batch budget stays
round-scoped, so maintainer feedback flows exactly as today.
Leading zeros are rejected, not just non-digits: bash [[ -gt ]]
reads a zero-padded operand as OCTAL, so '0400' would compare as
256 (the brake fires early) and '0900' raises "value too great
for base" inside [[ ]], which under an if-condition silently
evaluates false — the brake never engages. Both violate the
documented fallback promise, so pad-shaped values fall back too.

An orphan-history branch (fork takeover / adoption admits one —
nothing on this job's fetch requires a common ancestor) has no
merge base: the three-dot diff exits 128. Fail OPEN to zero like
the merge-tree conflict probe above — an unmeasurable PR skips
the brake rather than dying red at measurement every round.
A managed fork PR whose head branch is literally named 'main'
makes prepare's fork update-ref re-point refs/remotes/origin/main
at the fork head — the measurement would compare the branch
against itself (0/0 forever). Unmeasurable: skip the brake
(fail open), like the no-merge-base case.
Unmeasurable is a STATE, not a zero: substituting 0 nets would
anchor a bogus 0/0 baseline (or, against an existing anchor,
manufacture phantom growth). NET_MEASURED gates the whole brake:
no anchor, no marker, no engagement.

```text
The marker's window field is spelled `key=`, NOT `win=`: this
marker can legitimately carry a different window key than its
comment's autofix-eval marker (a supersede-exempt conflict round
reporting after a re-arm). The window censuses attribute
positionally (last-wins) over their own scan-parsed eval
markers, and the distinct token stays as defense in depth for
any future substring consumer.
A stale-base auto-update merges current main into the branch,
moving the merge base the nets are measured against: overlap
resolutions then shift the measurement with no agent push. An
anchor recorded before the latest base update is not comparable
any more — ignore it, so the next round re-anchors at the
post-update size. (A conflict round's own merge of main is the
narrower residual; its delta is bounded by the overlap.)

feedback items are bucketed into the (prev marker ts, marker ts]

ran in Critical-only territory (acted rounds numbered past the

distinct consumed spans to land here. Fresh, not-yet-evaluated
feedback never counts against its own author, and everything is
window-scoped so a /retry resets the budget with the window.
Only feedback the deferred renderer below would actually defer is
counted: Critical-tagged items, Request changes / APPROVED reviews,

two — each a full agent run with nothing pushed). From the
second attempt on, tell the agent to narrow. Counted since
the last pushed/no-change round, NOT cumulatively: a push
falsifies "not converging" and resets the count, so a recovered
PR stops seeing the warning; until a round pushes or no-ops it
fires on every failing round (gate rejections included) —
correctly, since nothing has converged yet. (The
BREAKER in the report step stays cumulative — a push does not
make the next timeout cheaper in budget terms.) Window-scoped
like every other census (LIVE_REARM_KEY is the live window),

headline verbatim: first lines can embed provider error text
(API_ERROR_DETAIL), so a loose phrase could count a model

Bound the agent below the job timeout so a runaway agent fails THIS
step (not the whole job), leaving the always() verify and report
steps time to run and post a handoff. A job-level timeout would
cancel those steps too and leave the loop silent.

This step timeout is the BACKSTOP for a runaway that ignores the
agent's own timer; QWEN_TIMEOUT_MS below is the real budget.
Invariant: budget <= backstop - margin, where the margin covers
the internal kill path (SIGTERM, 10s grace, SIGKILL, marker write).

Measured on run 30646547838:

  setup (12 steps, ends at 'Post autofix status comment')  5-7m
  Triage and address   #8005 round 9  50m03s (its own timer)
                       #8211          12m45s
  Verification gate    #8211          22m48s
  push + report + finalize                     3-4s

Setup runs in EARLIER steps, so it never competes with the agent
for this cap. Worst-case budget:

  setup                    7
  Triage and address     130  (120 budget + 10 margin)
  Verification gate       60  (2.6x the measured 22m48s)
  Repair                  20
  Repair verification     60
  report                   3
  -------------------------------
  worst case             280  => job timeout 300, and the job runs
                                 on ubuntu-latest, whose own ceiling

```text
Clamp the override to the budget ceiling: a repo variable past
7,200,000 ms (120m) would arm the timer past the 130-minute step
backstop, the cap would fire first, and the round would be
misreported as a crash. Malformed values fall back to the same
ceiling (run-agent.mjs's own || handles the empty/NaN case).
The {1,8} width bound keeps 10# inside int64: a 19+ digit value
wraps negative in (( )) and slips past the comparison unclamped.
10# forces base-10: a zero-padded value is octal in (( )) and would
error past the guard the same way.
A FLOOR, not just a ceiling — and the floor guards the likelier
mistake. Every comment here, the PR body and the operator message
all speak in MINUTES; this one variable wants MILLISECONDS. A
maintainer told to "raise the agent time budget" who sets
QWEN_AUTOFIX_TIMEOUT_MS=120 arms a 120 ms timer: every round
SIGTERMs instantly, writes agent-timeout, and reports "ran out of
time (timeout (120ms))" until TIMEOUT_WINDOW_CAP trips and AutoFix
stops on the PR — advising the human to raise the budget they just
raised, with no ::warning:: anywhere in that loop. 60000 rejects
every minutes-shaped value (1..999) and every 0/000, which the
bare regex admitted while the message claimed positivity.
Hand-maintained sibling of the triage-budget sanitize step in
qwen-triage.yml's authorize job; the failure modes deliberately
differ (this one clamps garbage to the ceiling, that one falls
back to the default), so a boundary-bug fix in one must be
re-derived in the other.

```text
Resolve the review threads whose findings the agent actually
IMPLEMENTED, so a human re-reviewing sees only what is still open
instead of re-reading every thread to work out what was handled.
The agent cannot do this itself - its sandbox carries no token -
so it records the inline-comment ids it implemented and this step,
which already holds the PAT, maps each to its thread. Findings it
DECLINED or deferred are deliberately left open. Best-effort
throughout: a resolve failure must never fail a good push.
Both this resolve block and the reply block below map an
inline-comment id to its review thread, so the threads are
fetched once here and shared. Hoisted above both so a round that
only replies (no resolved-comments.txt) still has them.
Paginated, because GitHub returns reviewThreads in ASCENDING
creation order: a single first-100 page is the OLDEST hundred,
which on a long-running PR is precisely not the threads this
round is answering. Measured on #8403 (1256 threads): one page
reached 8% of them, so an implemented Critical past it stayed
open and read as unaddressed, and a decline past it was answered
by silence — the two outcomes this function exists to prevent.
A partial fetch is USED, not discarded: losing twelve good pages
to a rate limit on the thirteenth would resolve nothing at all,
so the failure is announced and the threads in hand still map.
Residual: a thread with more than 100 comments still truncates,
so a comment past that page is unmapped and each block falls
back to the id as given; announced below, and unobserved so far.
Do NOT close that residual by adding endCursor to the inner
comments pageInfo: gh's paginator adopts the FIRST pageInfo
carrying both hasNextPage and endCursor, so the inner one would
hijack the thread-page cursor and stop after page one (exit 0, no
warning) — silently restoring the oldest-hundred bug this fetch
exists to fix. The outer cursor wins only because the inner
pageInfo asks for hasNextPage alone. The outer field ORDER is
load-bearing for the same reason: the scanner carries its flags
across pageInfo objects and breaks at the first one yielding
both, so alphabetizing to pageInfo{endCursor hasNextPage} makes
it break on the outer endCursor while hasNextPage still carries
the last INNER page's value (almost always false — thread comment
pages rarely truncate, and the outer page's own hasNextPage is
read only after the break) — gh then returns no cursor and the
walk silently stops after page one.

gh's stderr goes to a fresh mktemp regular file, never a named
WORKDIR path: WORKDIR is bind-mounted read-write into the agent
sandbox, so branch code from the round that just ran can plant
anything it likes at a predictable name here. A planted FIFO
blocks bash's O_WRONLY open before gh even execs, and the only
reader is the tail below gh — so the step would hang to the job
timeout AFTER the push landed, losing the report and the round
markers and breaking this block's own invariant that a resolve
failure must never fail a good push. A planted symlink would
instead truncate its target and fold 300 bytes of it into a
public ::warning::. Same reasoning, same shape as the `gh api
user` checks elsewhere in this file.

stream is consumed inline into a shell variable and never

slurp normalizer the paginated WORKDIR fetches share.
Keep only thread-shaped documents: on a failing page gh skips
--jq and appends that page's raw response body (a rate-limit
message, or a GraphQL error envelope) to stdout after the good
nodes. Slurped unfiltered it becomes a stray element, and the
consumers below iterate .comments.nodes[] over it and exit 5 —
which under errexit aborts this step AFTER a good push, losing
the report and the markers. Both invariants above forbid that:
a resolve failure must never fail a good push, and a partial
fetch is used rather than discarded.

Deferred-findings persistence, shared by both arms below.

No agent-writable path takes part in this. The script CONTENT
travels in expression context — captured at stage time from the
trusted checkout — so there is no staged copy to verify, and with
it go the digest gate, its check-then-use window, and the
planted-FIFO/huge-file reads that a path-based read invites. The
child's own messages travel on fd 3, which the parent captures,
while fd 1/2 are discarded; every loader side channel (auxv dumps,
ldd traces, whatever is next) writes there and cannot reach the
parsed output, and there is no log file to plant, race or bound.

/usr/bin/env is invoked by ABSOLUTE PATH: bash never does
function/alias lookup on a slash-bearing word, so a planted
BASH_FUNC_env%% cannot intercept the bootstrap. `-i` then drops
every BASH_FUNC_* import, BASH_ENV, SHELLOPTS, alias and trap.
LD_* is the one family env -i cannot block (ld.so acts while
loading env itself), so the ones that MATTER are cleared by
command-prefix assignment and the rest are caught by verifying the
RESULT: the child prints a liveness sentinel first, and its
absence — trace mode, exec failure, a missing interpreter — is
reported rather than passing silently for a successful round.

across ~27 runner registrations and review-address fans out
max-parallel, so a concurrent job can rewrite ~/.gitconfig inside
this step's sweep->push window (a URL-scoped sslVerify=false there
overrides the -c pin below over real TLS); redirect global/system
to a per-run throwaway (as the gates do) so the push reads neither.
Env channels: branch code in an earlier step of THIS job can inject
env through $GITHUB_ENV, and several channels OUTRANK file config or
bypass it entirely — pin PATH to the staged trusted value and drop
LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT/LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (else a swapped
git/sha256sum/bash defeats the digest gate below), then strip
GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/_PARAMETERS (command-line-precedence config),
GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL (env twin of protocol.allow — arms ext::),

per-PR head-write concurrency group serialises THIS repo's
workflows, but it cannot stop the PR author (or anything on the

stated budget widened it from ~50m, so a race-lost push is that
much likelier and the retry loop below stays bounded at 3 merges.
Observed twice in one day (#7983, #7985): a one-shot push died
`fetch first` and a full verified agent run was thrown away.
On rejection, fetch the moved head and MERGE it into the local
line (merge, not rebase: the agent's own conflict-resolution
rounds create merge commits, and a rebase would flatten them
and can silently re-introduce the conflicts it resolved). The
merge result descends from the remote head, so the retried push
is a fast-forward. A genuine content conflict aborts and falls

and the next scan re-targets the same feedback forever.

SUPPRESS entirely once "Push and report" already handled this run
(OUTCOME fixed or noop). That step is also always()-gated and runs even
if a LATER always() step (e.g. artifact upload) fails the job; without
this guard, such a late failure would flip JOB_STATUS to failure and
post a contradictory acted=false handoff on top of the published fix.
(A genuine push failure leaves OUTCOME=fixed but writes no marker, so
the next scan simply retries — it does not need a handoff here.)

SUPPRESS likewise for a stale-discarded run: it did no work, so a

deliberate no-comment/no-marker discard into a handoff that

the 中文说明 <details> wrapper — a bare `</details` in the

zh excerpt outside it.
`cut -c` counts BYTES, so the cap can split a multi-byte
character - and the classifier deliberately matches CJK renders,
so a >200-byte Chinese error is a supported input, not a
hypothetical. iconv -c drops the dangling bytes so the headline
stays valid UTF-8; it EXITS 1 when it discards one, which under

scan's max-round guard skips this PR instead of re-handing-off every
tick, without pretending the unread feedback was evaluated. The final
sentinel guards a cascading API failure that left WATERMARK empty too:
an empty ts= would not match the scan's `ts=([^ ]+)` regex, so the
terminal marker would be ignored and the PR re-handed-off. A far-future
ISO-8601 date is used (not a bare word) so it is both non-empty AND
sorts above any real timestamp in EVAL_WM's max, belt-and-suspenders
with the terminal round.
The gate declares its verdict explicitly (failed / noop / fixed).
An EMPTY outcome on a non-success job means it died BEFORE reaching
one - its own crash (a gate bug, an infra blip, a resolver error),
not a judgement on the agent's work. That must retry like any other
pre-verdict crash instead of advancing the watermark: the
nested-package ENOENT that stranded #7329/#7336 looked exactly like
a rejection, so a fix the agent had already written was discarded
and the PR sat idle until a human deleted the marker by hand.

Prepare ran (NEWEST is set) but no verdict was reached. Ways
that happens, and in ALL of them the agent evaluated NOTHING:
it produced no output at all (crashed before any verdict — a
staged runner that fails to boot), it died on a model
[API Error] (access/quota/5xx/transport), it TIMED OUT before
finishing, or the gate crashed after the agent wrote its
summary. So the watermark
must NOT advance past this feedback: an advance makes the next
scan see "nothing new" and never retry, stranding the PR on a
transient failure (an infra blip, a quota reset minutes away, a
model-access grant, a base-image bug fixed minutes later).
Stamp the sentinel ts (excluded from EVAL_WM) so the feedback
stays live and the next scan retries; the incremented round
still bounds retries before a terminal handoff, so a PERSISTENT
failure cannot loop forever.

```text
The gate ran and rejected the agent's fix (a build/test
failure). Before handing to a human, check whether the PR is
merely BEHIND main: a build that fails on something main
already changed — e.g. #7471's update-notifier, removed by
#7515, left its import unresolved on a stale branch — is a
stale-base failure, NOT the fix. If behind, merge main in and
retry: the next round builds against current main. After the
update the PR is current, so a genuine fix-failure next round
is no longer "behind" and falls through to the handoff below —
which self-limits this to ONE base-update. update-branch is a
CAS on the checked-out head; any API failure is fail-safe (fall
through to the handoff). This is the agent-gate sibling of the
scan's stale-base auto-update, which only sees PR status
checks, never the gate's own build.

Name the gate ONLY when it actually ran: this branch is
reached for every outcome=failed verdict, but reject_fix

Pre-existing failures get the honest clause: the rejection
is not the agent's and the repair was deliberately skipped.
The remedy depends on WHY it pre-exists, and this branch
only renders when the stale-base auto-update above did NOT
fire — which includes a branch current with main whose own
pre-round commits carry the failure, where "merge main"
changes nothing. CMP_R is assigned only when BOTH gh api
calls above succeed (each swallows failure into ''), so
an EMPTY CMP_R means the compare never ran — "measured
not-behind" and "never measured" get separate clauses:
the latter cannot assert the branch's own code is at

```text
NEWEST is empty because Prepare never RAN TO A VERDICT — an
earlier step failed or the job stopped before the agent started:
installing/building the trusted base, node setup. That
is infra or a broken base, NOT the agent, and it is usually
transient (a base build fixed minutes later, an ENOSPC runner).
Match on "not a real Prepare run" rather than 'skipped' alone, so
this also covers a CANCELLED job (outcome 'cancelled') and a job
that stopped before Prepare even entered the step context
(outcome ''): a concurrency/manual cancel is not the agent's
fault either, and 'cancelled' is a DISTINCT value from 'skipped'
— matching only 'skipped' would send a cancel to the terminal
branch below. Terminal here is wrong: a web-shell TS break on
main failed the base build across a whole scan batch and stranded
SIX healthy PRs terminally, including ones at round 11. Retry
instead — sentinel ts keeps the feedback live — but still
increment the round so a PERSISTENTLY broken base is bounded and
cannot loop forever.

### 69. review-address · Report dry-run / failure — Consecutive-failure circuit breaker, distinct from the round cap.

In `review-address` · `Report dry-run / failure`.

```text
Consecutive-failure circuit breaker, distinct from the round cap.
Reaching this step at all means this round did NOT push (the push
and no-op paths report from "Push and report"), so this round is a
failure. Count how many failures precede it WITHOUT a break: walk
the bot's prior eval markers in API order (oldest-first, pinned
by sort_by so a stray reorder cannot corrupt the streak) and
reset the streak at each push ("Addressed the latest review
feedback"), deliberate no-op ("no changes needed"), or pre-agent
infra-failure marker ("AutoFix could not start"). After the
full walk, CONSEC_FAIL holds failures since the last progress
point plus one for this round. If the unbroken
streak (this round included) reaches the cap, stop retrying even
under takeover: a PR that fails this many times running is stuck
on something a re-run at the same budget will not fix (observed on
#6723: 7 straight failures, 3 timeouts + 4 gate rejections). Only
overrides a would-be RETRY — a round already terminal for another
reason keeps its own headline.
Transient model errors (429/5xx) are exempt: the CAUSE_MAX logic
above deliberately gives them the full round budget because they
self-heal once the provider recovers. Letting the breaker override
that would mark every in-flight PR terminal at once during a
provider outage — the failures are not the PR's fault and DO
self-heal. Auth errors are NOT exempt (they never self-heal).
Pre-agent infra failures (skipped/cancelled/empty Prepare outcome)
are exempt for the same reason: a broken base build or a runner
crash is not the PR's fault, self-heals, and hits the whole scan
batch at once — the exact scenario the retry path above exists to
prevent. The round cap + sentinel-ts /retry recovery already
bounds a persistently broken base. A stale-base retry (the gate
rejected the fix but the PR was behind main, so the base was just
updated) is exempt for the same reason — it is not the PR's fault
and self-limits to one round (after the update the PR is current).

Flip the status comment out of "working" so a finished round never
leaves a live-looking line behind. PATCH-only on purpose: a round that
never posted a status (stale duplicate, dry run) must not gain one here.
The verdict stays in the round report this job already posts; this only
records that the round ended, and keeps the run link reachable.
Gated on 'stale' for the same reason the announcement is: the per-PR
concurrency group serialises duplicate address jobs, so the discarded
one runs AFTER the real round already finalised. Ungated, it would
overwrite that round's "finished" with its own "ended without
publishing" and report a successful round as a failed one. An empty
'stale' (prepare itself crashed) still finalises — that IS this job's
round, and it is exactly the case that must not stay "working".

### 73. review-address · Report dry-run / failure — Idle (silent-sandbox) timeouts are EXCLUDED from the cumulative timeout cap.

In `review-address` · `Report dry-run / failure`.

```text
TIMEOUT_WINDOW_CAP exists to stop a PR that is too big to finish a
round inside the agent's time budget; its remedy says so ("split or
reduce the PR, or raise the agent time budget AND its step backstop").
An idle timeout is a different failure entirely: run-agent.mjs's idle
watchdog kills the round after QWEN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS (20m) because the
sandbox produced no output at all — the four observed hangs (#8663 x2,
#8761 r3, #8763 r4) each printed their last byte at docker container
entry and then sat silent. Nothing about the PR caused it, and the
breaker's own headline already told the reader that "no budget increase
can cure" it. Counting a failure whose prescribed remedy is
inapplicable is what parked healthy PRs.

Measured on 2026-08-21, over the preceding 14 days: 119 timeouts, of
which 58 (49%) were idle. 51 windows tripped this cap, every one of
them at exactly N=3. Of the 12 open PRs then carrying
autofix/needs-human, 9 had been stopped here — #8332 at 24 rounds,
#8368 at 28, #8276 at 16, all still producing pushed rounds when they
were parked. With idle rounds counted, the fleet timeout rate was
8.5% per round, so a window accumulated three of them in ~35 rounds by
arithmetic alone, independent of whether the PR was stuck. Excluding
idle drops the rate to 4.3%, which needs ~69 rounds — beyond the
deepest window ever observed (22/100).

The escape hatch that makes the exclusion safe: an idle round pushes
nothing and matches none of CONSEC_FAIL's streak-reset needles
("Addressed the latest review feedback", "no changes needed", "AutoFix
could not start", "updated a stale base"), so a persistently wedged
sandbox still terminates the PR at CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_CAP. What no
longer terminates it is idle rounds INTERLEAVED with real progress —
which is the intended change: that PR is not stuck, the runner is.

Two consequences inside the block. IDLE_N's needle became the full
emitted headline prefix ('AutoFix ran out of time before finishing
(idle-timeout') rather than a bare 'idle-timeout' substring: IDLE_N is
now subtracted from TIMEOUT_N, so it MUST be a subset of it, and a
loose needle could otherwise match provider error text that
API_ERROR_DETAIL puts on the same first line and drive the difference
negative. And the all-idle remedy branch is gone as unreachable: the
guard now fires only when BUDGET_TIMEOUT_N alone reaches the cap, so a
tripped window always holds at least TIMEOUT_WINDOW_CAP genuine budget
timeouts — idle rounds can outnumber budget ones in it, but the budget
remedy applies because those budget timeouts exist, not because they
are the majority.

Idle rounds stay visible through a job-log ::warning:: rather than a PR
comment — the signal belongs to whoever owns the runners, and infra
noise should not spend a comment on someone's PR. The census and its
warning run outside the cap's terminal guard: the all-idle shape stops
via the consecutive breaker with that breaker's headline, and the
terminal run's log is exactly where the wedged runner must be named.

The same exclusion applies to the prepare step's PRIOR_TIMEOUTS census
(af-049): its budget warning tells the agent to narrow scope — the
budget remedy again — and an idle round never exhausted any budget, so
it must not steer the narrowing. Idle rounds are excluded there with
the same needle the cap census uses.

Per-author tail budget inside Critical-only mode. An account is an
ACCOUNTABILITY unit, not a throttle: a human login can host an automated
reviewer loop with the exact regeneration property the review bot has
(feedback re-generated after every push, at zero marginal cost). So the
brake keys on measured regeneration, not identity: every source gets a
bounded number of untagged feedback batches per counting window once
Critical-only engages — the review bot's budget is zero (all deferred),
a human's is this many CONSUMED batches. Past it, continuing requires
one conscious act (starting a comment with **[Critical]**, a Request changes review, or /retry),
which is precisely what separates intent from automation.

In `run`.

```text
Growth audit: a budget breach engages Critical-only AND makes the round a
growth-audit round. The agent audits the PR's approach on two axes — KISS
(name a structurally simpler alternative or prove each piece load-bearing)
and minimal change (every changed hunk traces to the PR's problem, an
accepted finding, or a failing check) — and records a machine-readable
verdict (sound/drift/conflict) in growth-audit.json, which the
verification gate requires in audit rounds. sound re-arms the window at
the current size (audit-gated /retry) and the loop continues; drift
simplifies first, then continues; conflict is the ONLY growth path to a
human, and it idles subsequent scans until a trusted human responds. A
size signal triggers a JUDGMENT, never a stop: solving the problem is
primary, growth control secondary. See docs/design/autofix-growth-audit.md.
An auth/access model error (401/402/403, "no access"/"does not exist")
never self-heals - only a maintainer can fix the key - and every retry
costs an agent run AND a PR comment. Cap those attempts far below
MAX_ROUNDS so the actionable "check the model key" message lands in an
hour instead of a day. Transient (429/5xx) errors keep the full budget.

Failed-check annotation patterns that mean the INFRASTRUCTURE died, not the
code — a self-hosted runner losing the server, the disk filling, a runner
shutdown, or a git fetch/clone dying mid-transfer. Such a check is red for a
reason unrelated to the PR and clears on a re-run (observed: #7490's E2E
"runner lost communication"; #6506's checkout "RPC failed; curl 92" /
"fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output" — both green on the rerun). The scan
auto-reruns those failed jobs ONCE, guarded by run_attempt so a persistent
infra problem cannot loop. Deliberately conservative — only unambiguous
machine/transport failures, never a bare test-level timeout, which could be
a real regression (a co-present timeout does not block a match — one
matching line classifies the run). Case-insensitive, vs the annotations.

The literal here is only the fallback when the variable is unset.
Why 30: 37 PRs carried autofix/takeover on 2026-08-08, so the previous
budget of 10 emitted at most 27% of the eligible set per tick and pushed
the rest a scan further out every time. It must also stay strictly above
the address matrix's max-parallel or the matrix can never fill, and the
same-repo candidate pool was 51, so 30 still bounds a pathological
backlog. RAISE BOTH TOGETHER: this must stay above QWEN_AUTOFIX_MAX_PARALLEL.

feedback, and a deferred PR with a live conflict is still picked up by
the shepherd's conflict lever.

one gates whether a PR is even LOOKED AT, so it has to grow ahead of the

Commit-status context stamped PENDING on a PR head when a scan dispatches

materialization: build-cli runs in between, and until the matrix expands
the leg does not exist in the live-run jobs view, so an overlapping scan
would re-dispatch the same PR. The scan treats a PENDING marker fresher
than DISPATCH_STATUS_TTL_MINUTES as busy (a run that dies before the leg
materializes leaves a marker that expires by age). Commit statuses only —
the check-run creation API needs a GitHub App, and this workflow
authenticates with a PAT. Same-repo heads only get a stamp: a fork head
sha does not exist in this repo's object store.

Consecutive-failure sub-cap, distinct from the total round cap (TAKEOVER_MAX_ROUNDS, documented at its declaration in qwen-autofix.yml). The
total cap bounds how many PRODUCTIVE rounds a PR may take; this bounds how
many rounds may fail IN A ROW with nothing pushed. Under takeover a PR gets
up to 100 rounds, but a PR that fails to push this many times running is not
iterating, it is stuck — a too-large / fast-conflicting PR whose fix keeps
timing out or failing the gate. Retrying at the same budget will not fix
that; a human has to rebase or split it. Any pushed round OR a legitimate
"no changes needed" no-op resets the streak, so this only ever fires on an
unbroken run of failures. Observed on #6723: 7 straight failed rounds (3

runner time) and pushes nothing. Observed on #7929: three timeouts with
pushed rounds in between, so the consecutive cap never fired and the PR
kept walking into the same wall; #7846 the same, twice. Counted over the
current counting window (window-scoped like every other census), so a

label must stay as the only filterable escalation state. Skip
also wins over re-arm everywhere (a frozen PR keeps its label),

neither visible to a job `if:`, which cannot read the `secrets`

markers of the CURRENT window count toward the cap. Timestamp
windowing would race an in-flight address job selected before a
re-arm: its marker lands AFTER the ack and would instantly

the highest round wins (a terminal handoff marker must make the

CANCELLED is deliberately omitted from the PR-side selector: a
cancelled check is not evidence of a stale base. External commit
statuses are also excluded: a StatusContext exposes .context, not

The staged copies' trusted-base provenance holds at cp time only:
RUNNER_TEMP is writable by the branch/agent code later steps run
on this host, so the two digested copies — resanitize-git-config.sh
and run-autofix-review-verification.sh — record each digest in
GITHUB_OUTPUT — expression context, which a disk write after staging
cannot reach — for the invoking step to verify before execution.
(The step's other staged scripts carry no digest.) The gate runner is
pinned too: it runs the branch's own build/test between the two
gate passes, so an unverified copy would let the branch define
its own verdict. The trusted PATH is recorded before any branch
code runs, so a $GITHUB_ENV-planted PATH/preload cannot swap the
sha256sum/bash/git the steps resolve (that would defeat the digest
gate itself).

pushing round and would re-anchor on the bot's own fixes, zeroing
the census in exactly the push regime the handoff exists for. A
correct version needs both a bot-authored-move test and a

In `review-address` · `Prepare branch and feedback`.

```text
Growth audit: a budget breach engages Critical-only AND makes the
round a growth-audit round — a size signal triggers a JUDGMENT,
never a stop. The agent audits the approach (KISS + minimal
change, burden of proof inverted) and records a machine-readable
verdict the verification gate requires: sound re-arms the window
at the current size and the loop continues, drift simplifies
first, conflict is the only growth path to a human. Count this
window's prior per-round over-budget rounds for the audit's
context (the trajectory clause in feedback.md uses the same
number). Read this window's prior per-round growth markers
(written by the report step):
<!-- autofix-growth-now src=N test=N over=BOOL round=N run=ID measured=TS key=W -->
Deduped by run=GITHUB_RUN_ID (the per-workflow-run id) and ORDERED
by measured=: the report post's bounded retry re-posts one run's
marker, and a failed job's re-run keeps the same run_id, so a run
collapses to its LATEST measurement — and that collapse happens
BEFORE the over/window/cutoff filters, or a re-run that came back
under budget would still be represented by its stale over=true
attempt. Within the collapse an explicit measured= beats the
created_at fallback: a re-run attempt that crashed BEFORE prepare
— or whose measurement failed — posts an inert over=false marker
with no measured=, whose fallback (post-run) timestamp would
otherwise outdate and erase the same run's real prepare-time
measurement. Every distinct address run has a fresh run_id.
KNOWN RESIDUAL (#9114): during the one-time deploy transition a
run whose FIRST attempt posted a legacy (no measured=) over=true
marker and whose re-run crashes before prepare still collapses
fallback-vs-fallback on created_at — the later inert marker wins
and erases the count. Self-limiting: once deployed, every real
measurement carries measured= and beats any inert marker.
round=/eval-watermark are NOT a safe identity — a state-triggered
lane (a persistent merge conflict selects the PR every scan with no
new evaluable feedback) freezes both NEWEST and ROUND, so distinct
over-budget runs would share them and collapse, stalling the count.
Filtered on measured= (the prepare-time measurement instant, NOT
the comment's post-agent created_at) after GROWTH_NOW_CUTOFF, so a
round measured against a pre-base-update tree is dropped rather
than counted in this window's census. KNOWN RESIDUAL (#9114): the
tree is fixed at the branch fetch/checkout while the cutoff comes
from ic.json fetched afterwards, so a base update landing between
the fetch and the measured_at stamp admits a pre-update marker;
self-heals at the next re-arm/base update. measured= is OPTIONAL
in the scan: markers posted before it existed fall back to their
comment's created_at, so deploying this does not blank the census
of a window that is already in flight.
The CURRENT run's own markers are excluded (run != GITHUB_RUN_ID):
a re-run of a failed job keeps the same run id and its failed
attempt already posted a marker, so counting it would over-report
the round's own attempt as a PRIOR one.

```text
Conflict-handoff idempotence: a conflict verdict parks the PR at
a genuinely human call. Until a trusted human responds, scans
must not launch agents or post comments — review-bot regeneration
alone (an update-branch merge re-reviews every new head) would
otherwise churn one identical handoff after another. Wake only on
feedback the loop cannot produce itself: trusted-human
reviews/comments, or a failing check from OUTSIDE the Qwen Autofix
workflow (a CI build/test the loop did not run). The Qwen Autofix
workflow's OWN check runs are excluded wholesale: under a park no
address round can legitimately run, so any review-address check
newer than the marker is necessarily the conflict round's own
failed check (posted after the handoff) — counting it would let
the loop's own output unpark the very round it came from, and the
resulting wasted failure rounds feed CONSEC_FAIL toward a terminal
lockout on the exact PR a human is trying to settle. A manual
job re-run reaches prepare and parks green (no failed check), and
/retry remains the sanctioned lift. A /retry re-arm moves
LIVE_REARM_KEY past the marker's win= and lifts the park on its
own.
Two more loop-generated events must not wake: a stale-base
auto-update is the loop's OWN head move — the red checks it
REACTS to completed before its marker (they are the condition it
handles, not human feedback), so the checks leg counts only
failures completing after BOTH the conflict marker and the
latest base update; and CANCELLED never wakes — an
update-branch push cancels in-flight runs on the old head (and a
close/reopen does the same), which the loop produces without any
human.
The exclusion set is wider than the loop's own workflow: the
loop's SIBLING machinery produces check events too — the review
workflow re-fires on every head the loop's own base-update merge
creates, the CI-failure patrol re-runs flaky failures on the
UNCHANGED head by cron, and the fork lanes carry the loop's own
checks for fork PRs. All of it completes after both clocks with
no human anywhere in the input, so all of it is excluded by
name; and while a handoff pends, the loop performs NO head
moves at all (the scan's stale-base auto-update and the
conflict round's own stale-base retry both skip parked PRs),
so any check newer than both clocks is human-caused.

The agent below runs for up to 130 minutes and the verification gate adds
more, but nothing reaches the PR thread until "Push and report" at the

tell a working round from a stuck one. The agent's output already
streams live to the Actions log, so publish that link up front.
Upserted by marker so one status comment per PR is EDITED each round
(edits notify nobody) rather than stacking a new comment against a
100-round cap. Runs after prepare so a revalidated-away stale duplicate
never announces a round it will not run. Best-effort: a status post that
fails warns and continues — it must never cost the round.

The primary attempt's real budget: 120m, with a 10-minute margin
under the 130-minute step backstop above. The margin covers the
internal kill path (SIGTERM, 10s grace, SIGKILL, marker write);
if the step cap fires first, `agent-timeout` is never written and
the report step misclassifies the round as a crash.
QWEN_AUTOFIX_TIMEOUT_MS can only LOWER the fallback without a code
change: the run block clamps it to the 7,200,000 ms ceiling
(BUDGET_CAP_MS, the fallback itself), so raising the budget still
requires editing this default, BUDGET_CAP_MS, and the step backstop,
while a misconfigured variable degrades to a warning, not a misreport.

three timeouts with successes in between; #7846 twice). The
census reuses PRIOR_HEADS, so it is window-scoped exactly
like the consecutive one and a re-arm clears it. Only the

terminal keeps its own headline (the consecutive breaker
included). The idle census and its warning run OUTSIDE that

In `route` and `review-scan`.

```text
route and review-scan run on the persistent pool, not the
hosted one. They are short trusted base-repo jobs, but they
gate the WHOLE fan-out: while they sit queued, no
review-address leg starts. On 2026-08-25 a hosted-runner
backlog queued route for over 20 minutes — longer than the
cron period — and af-005's newer-tick-supersedes-older rule
then cancelled every still-queued round: nine consecutive
schedule runs died without scanning while the ecs-qwen pool
stood mostly idle. The supersede rule stays — it is right
once route gets a runner in seconds; the fix is taking the
hosted queue out of the critical path. review-scan moves
with it because it shares the gate, and its own hosted waits
delayed every fan-out by the same backlog. Both keep the
fork-trust clause of the sibling lanes: pull_request and
pull_request_review resolve this file from the PR's own
merge commit, so only same-repo heads and write-access
authors may reach the persistent pool; everything else stays
hosted, and the kill-switch wins everywhere. Neither job
checks code out — route only decides phases, and review-scan
only calls the API — so the shared workspace needs no
restore or wipe step here. The pool still leaves two marks
on the lane, both closed in the same change. One: gh reads
its config from the shared, attacker-writable $HOME, so both
steps carry the heavy jobs' gh hardening preamble — a planted
~/.config/gh/config.yml could reroute their gh calls into a
local socket, taking CI_DEV_BOT_PAT with the scan and forged
collaborator-permission answers with route. Two: review-scan
fills a per-run WORKDIR with API dumps that no VM teardown
removes on the pool, so it gets a fixed autofix* per-run path
(the age sweep can reclaim it after a hard kill), an EXIT
trap, and an always() cleanup step mirroring issue-autofix.

### 149. review-address · Post autofix status comment — Round heartbeat: the announcement freezes at "working" for the whole round…

In `review-address` · `Post autofix status comment`.

```text
Round heartbeat: the announcement freezes at "working" for
the whole round — up to the 130-minute agent step plus gate
and repair — so on the PR page a healthy long round and a
dead one look identical (observed on #9739: ~1.5h of
silence). A detached loop started here re-PATCHes the SAME
comment every 10 min with elapsed time and last agent
activity (agent.log mtime — run-agent.mjs writes every
stream event there; no parsing, and the thinking phase's
10-minute stream-idle window shows as an honest "active N
min ago"). EDITING one comment, not posting: a managed PR
can run 100 rounds, and edits raise no issue_comment events
(no workflow fan-out) and no notifications. The body renders
through the heartbeat script's 'body' subcommand for the
initial post AND every tick, so the two texts cannot drift.

LIFETIME is bounded to the sandboxed agent phase: the
verification gate kills the loop BEFORE it runs the
branch's own build/tests ON THE HOST. The first design
claimed "no fork code runs on the host beside this loop"
for the whole round and review proved that false — the gate
script says plainly that the branch's code runs there as
the runner user. A PAT-holding host process concurrent with
host-side branch code is a /proc/<pid>/environ read away
from leaking the token (same UID; the pool's ptrace scope
does NOT stand between — it gates ptrace attach, not this
direct same-UID read; witnessed on the pool's host class:
a non-descendant sibling extracted an environ canary with
ptrace_scope=1), so the pulse covers the agent step — the
longest, sandboxed phase — and dies before the gate. The
comment holds its last tick through gate/repair; finalize
flips the terminal text.

KILL TARGETS travel through EXPRESSION CONTEXT: post_status
records $! as heartbeat_pid, and the gate / finalize / the
always() cleanup kill that value — delivered through each
killer's step-level env: block (the STATUS_ID shape), so the
runner sets it as data; an interpolation inside a run body
would substitute a forged output BEFORE the shell parses, so
it would execute as shell syntax in the consuming shell
(R16-1). Never a pid read from a
WORKDIR file: the agent's docker sandbox mounts the host
/tmp on the same path and runs as this same user, so branch
code the agent executes can plant any value in
heartbeat.pid — an arbitrary same-UID kill in the hand of
the next killer (this file class is known-hostile: the gate
refuses to re-read its verdict from WORKDIR for the same
reason). The on-disk pid file survives for diagnostics and
the loop's OWN existence self-check only — tampering there
can at worst end the pulse early or forge its "active"
figure, never reach a kill or the token. The killers are
INLINE bash in the yml: no PR-branch-controlled file is
ever executed in a PAT-bearing or post-agent context, and
the gate's own kill uses absolute-path/builtin command
words per that step's shadowing doctrine.

LIFECYCLE CONFIRMATION on every kill: the pid recorded at
launch can be REUSED between the launch and a kill — the
gate lands up to a whole agent phase after post_status
recorded the id, and finalize and the always() cleanup run
hours later still; by then the runner may have recycled
the number. The blind form was probe-verified fatal:
mapped to an unrelated detached session, the stale pid's
kill block terminated it (pid, group AND session TERM).
Every killer therefore confirms the pid's start time
before signaling: post_status also records the loop's
start time (heartbeat_start_ticks — field 22 of
/proc/<pid>/stat, clock ticks since boot; index 19 after
stripping through the LAST ')' of the parenthesized
comm), and a killer signals only a pid whose stat still
carries exactly that value. A reused pid necessarily
carries a different start time and a dead pid carries no
stat at all, so a failed check proves the loop is gone
and killing nothing is right — the confirmation can only
ever SUPPRESS a kill, never admit a wrong one (its
residual is the narrow stat-read→signal window, the same
residual the decimal check it replaces carried for its
whole lifetime).

PAT TRADE, chosen deliberately within that lifetime: the
loop holds the bot PAT in env — a temporal overlap the
"THIS step holds no PAT" rule (af-126) otherwise avoids.
Accepted because within the agent phase the token never
touches disk and the only host processes concurrent with
the loop are trusted (run-agent.mjs, the bundled CLI) —
plus two hardenings that keep the overlap honest. KILL:
the overlap ends at the gate only if the kill covers the
loop's whole SESSION — each tick's `timeout 60 gh` subtree
runs in its OWN process group (coreutils timeout default)
under the loop's setsid session, so a group/pid kill
landing mid-tick leaves it alive holding the PAT for up to
60s (witnessed on the pool's host class); all three
killers therefore kill pid, group, AND session. PINS: the
step's gh calls and every tick run under the af-112
hermetic pins — pinned GH_HOST, dropped
GH_TOKEN/GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN, and a fresh empty
GH_CONFIG_DIR minted around EVERY call (the loop mints
per tick, post_status mints per call inside its
hermetic_gh wrapper, finalize mints adjacent to its
single call) and removed right after. Without them the
default ~/.config/gh on the shared attacker-writable
HOME can carry http_unix_socket, and a planted same-UID
listener then receives the tick's Authorization header
WITH the PAT (witnessed with the pool's gh): exfil with
no orphan, no /proc read and no kill miss, inside the
legitimate overlap, where none of the trade arguments
above reaches. The mint sits under the same-UID-writable
RUNNER_TEMP, and a LONG-LIVED minted dir is itself
plantable between calls — a config.yml with
http_unix_socket written into it is read by the next
call, witnessed with the pool's gh on the loop's 600s
launch→first-call window (R11-1) — so the dir is minted
milliseconds before each call and removed right after:
the residual is a per-call mint→use race, not a
persistent channel. RESOLUTION: the af-112
pins close gh's CONFIG channel; the binary-resolution
channel is closed separately. The PAT-bearing step and
the loop both pin PATH from the stage-time TRUSTED_PATH
capture BEFORE the first command word resolves (the R6-3
doctrine): the job's own $GITHUB_PATH append keeps
${RUNNER_TEMP}/qwen-bin ahead of /usr/bin, and a same-UID
plant of gh/timeout/setsid/touch in any writable dir on
the ambient PATH would otherwise be resolved with the PAT
in env — witnessed: a planted setsid at launch and a
planted gh mid-tick both received the token; the pinned
forms never reached the plant. The loop validates the
capture like any other launch input and fails fast
without it; the killers in PAT-bearing steps take the
same absolute-path/builtin command words as the gate's
kill block. The alternative — heartbeat from the schedule
scan or a watcher job — lands every ~40-70 min in this
repo (af-027) and would re-derive comment id, run
identity and liveness remotely: too slow and too much
machinery for a pulse.

ORPHAN DISCIPLINE on the persistent pool: the loop
self-exits when the pid file no longer holds ITS OWN pid.
This is an identity check, not an existence check — WORKDIR
is PR-scoped, so after a crashed round's reset the next
round recreates heartbeat.pid at the SAME path; existence
alone would let the orphaned old loop pass and keep PATCHing
its stale body onto the comment. Reclamation by rewrite is
HOST-LOCAL: it fires only when the next same-PR round reuses
the orphan's host. Cross-host — the fleet's general case,
no per-PR runner affinity — nothing rewrites the file, the
orphan keeps passing its own identity check, and it pulses
its stale body onto the shared comment until the age cap
(accepted residual risk, with its REAL profile: the orphan
holds the bot PAT in /proc/<pid>/environ until the cap,
and any same-UID process on that host — including another
PR's round running its gate's host-side build/tests —
reads it directly; the pool's ptrace scope does not gate
this read, as witnessed above. The cap therefore sits just
past the 330-minute job envelope — only a crash orphan
ever reaches it, so the cap IS the bound on its token
window. A cross-run kill keyed on a WORKDIR pid would
reopen the untrusted-kill-target hole, so reclamation
stays host-local). Reading the file to self-identify is
safe (the loop never kills anything); the
killers never read it, which is what keeps the
untrusted-target hole closed — no cross-run kill. The other
bounds: a heartbeat-stop marker, or the age cap just past
the 330-minute job envelope; each tick's gh call is
additionally wrapped in a 60s timeout so a black-holed
connection cannot stall the loop past the cap. Killers that
run in-round touch the stop marker BEFORE killing so a
missed kill still ends the loop at its next self-check — a
tick landing after the terminal text would overwrite it
with a live-looking "working" line. The terminal text is
additionally DRAINED, not slept past: the fixed 2s sleep
proved wrong on probe — killing the client cannot cancel a
PATCH the server already ACCEPTED (reproduced: WORKING
accepted 1.67s in, TERMINAL submitted 3.80s in, the stale
WORKING committed 6.67s in and flipped the comment back to
live-looking). Each tick therefore stamps its start epoch
into heartbeat-tick-inflight around its gh call and
removes it after; finalize waits until the stamp is ABSENT
or older than the 65s completion bound (the tick's 60s
gh timeout plus margin) BEFORE its terminal PATCH — every
request started before that bound has committed or died
by the time the terminal text goes up. The stamp is a
wait input, never a kill target: a planted fresh stamp
costs at most the bound in finalize delay, a planted
deletion reopens only the cosmetic overwrite (nothing
rides the stamp but the comment text), and finalize's
read is bounded like the loop's pid-file read so a
planted FIFO cannot stall it.

Deep-link "Watch live progress" to THIS matrix leg's live
log, not just the run page: the run page lists every leg of
the scan and the reader must find which one is theirs. The
job id comes from the current run ATTEMPT's jobs listing
matched on the name prefix "review-address (<pr>," — the
matrix name format this job has always used — read through
jq with --arg so the PR number enters as data, never string
interpolation. BEST-EFFORT by construction: any lookup
failure (API error, unexpected shape) leaves the run URL, so
the link is never worse than before this existed. The
finalize text keeps the run URL on purpose: once the round
ends the run page is the right destination (all steps, all
attempts), and one less thing to re-resolve on the
crashed-agent paths where this step's outputs may be all
that survived.

### 151. run — Convergence-signal circuit breaker — the off-ramp the round and growth brakes cannot…

In `run`.

```text
Convergence-signal circuit breaker — the off-ramp the round and growth
brakes cannot provide (#10107). Every brake this loop had bounded its OWN
telemetry: rounds (CRITICAL_ONLY_AFTER_ROUND, the caps), bytes (the growth
budgets), failures (the consecutive-failure and timeout breakers). None of
them could see the one diagnosis that matters on a non-converging pair:
the REVIEW side has measured, since #9461/#9623, whether its own loop is
settling — recurrence clusters, a first-time-finding rate that is not
falling — and publishes the matched handling recommendations as a closed
code set (`rec` in the posted ledger marker, RECOMMENDATION_CODES in
packages/cli/src/commands/review/lib/convergence.ts). Measured on #9729:
the observation named the failure mode in round 3 and repeated it through
round 15, both sides' brakes engaged (critical floor from ~round 5; growth
brake, Critical-only), and the loop still ran ~13 more rounds — ~50
runner-hours, the PR growing +1.7k → +5.6k lines, round 15 still posting
fresh Criticals in loop-written code. The brakes slow each side; neither
can stop the pair, and the human who could is exactly the one takeover
removed from the loop.

The breaker consumes the codes instead of re-deriving the diagnosis: the
review module's contract is that it measures and holds no threshold ("a
caller wires actions to these codes without parsing prose"), so the
threshold lives here — CONVERGENCE_BREAK_ROUNDS consecutive signal-bearing
review rounds, with no trusted-human response in between, pause the loop.
Three by default: the review engages its own critical posting floor after
two flat rounds (#9938), so three signal rounds mean the posture rung has
already been taken and the pair demonstrably did not respond to it.

The action is a PARK in the growth-audit-conflict mold, not a terminal
stop: one visible notice, then silence; a trusted-human response resumes
the loop with a fresh N-round runway (the response steers the next rounds
as ordinary feedback); /retry or re-engaging takeover resets via the
window key like every other census. No NEEDS_HUMAN_LABEL — that label
marks stops only a re-arm can lift, and a self-lifting park wearing it
would leave the label lying the moment a maintainer's comment resumed
the loop. Downshifting automatic re-review falls out for free: reviews
are push-triggered, so a loop that stops pushing stops re-reviewing —
on-demand review (a human push, /review) keeps working.

'land-and-defer' and the persistently-critical exit advisory are
deliberately NOT signal codes: both mean "this loop can end by merging",
and pausing on them would park exactly the PR a human should merge. They
stay visible in the review body; acting on them is a different feature.

```text
Convergence-signal circuit breaker (#10107): the review side diagnoses a
non-converging loop in machine-readable form — the `rec` codes in its
posted ledger marker — and this gate is the consumer. See af-151 for the
concept; this section carries the reading's mechanics.

The streak is TRAILING and CONSECUTIVE: review-bot reviews after the
boundary, last ledger marker per body (an edited body can hold more than
one; the newest describes the round), one entry per ROUND keeping the
newest (the review workflow dismisses its own superseded reviews but the
dismissed body — and its marker — survives in the list, and a re-run of
one round must not count twice), reduced in TIME order — jq's group_by
re-sorts its input by the grouping key, so the dedup's output is re-sorted
by submitted_at before the reduce: round-NUMBER order would miscount in
the unsafe direction whenever a round lands out of order (a dismissed
round's healthy re-run landing late reads as a signal tail), reset to
zero by any marker round whose
codes do not intersect CONVERGENCE_SIGNAL_CODES. A review without a
parseable marker contributes nothing either way — fallback comments and
dismissal stubs are not rounds — while a marker without `rec` is a round
that measured no divergence (a healthy round, or one from a CLI predating
the field) and resets: the fail-open direction, one delayed breaker, never
a false park.

The boundary is max(window key, newest trusted-human activity). The
window-key half makes /retry and re-engagement reset the breaker exactly
like every other census. The human-activity half is the resume signal the
notice promises — a maintainer response moves the boundary past the streak:
the loop wakes with a fresh CONVERGENCE_BREAK_ROUNDS of runway, and the
response itself reaches the agent as ordinary feedback. The reviews arm
counts every state that records a response — CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED,
APPROVED, and DISMISSED: an approval resumes exactly like the notice
promises ("a review or comment counts"), and a dismissed review keeps the
boundary where the human put it, so a dismissal can never snap the
boundary back to the window key and silently re-park under the stale
pre-resume notice. The legs mirror
the conflict park's wake legs (trusted-human reviews, inline comments,
issue comments minus bot markers and @qwen-code commands) with one
deliberate difference: NO failed-check leg. The conflict park wakes on
outside CI going red because its parked item is a size judgment and a
broken tree outranks it; this park's whole claim is that more automatic
rounds are the problem, and a red check resuming the general loop would
re-open it with zero human input. Trust: the streak reads only reviews
the REVIEW_BOT account submitted — a review is not a forgeable surface
the way an issue comment is — and the boundary can only be moved LATER by
untrusted input, which is the safe direction (a later boundary shortens
the streak and delays the park).

The notice posts once per boundary, not once per window: a loop that
resumed on a human response and re-tripped earned a fresh notice, and the
earlier one is older than the activity that resumed it, so the dedup
(AUTOFIX_BOT comments carrying the marker, newer than the boundary) reads
exactly that. It deliberately does NOT begin "🤖 AutoFix stopped" — the
fleet shepherd's REASON regex reads that prefix as a terminal stop, and
this is a self-lifting park. The verdict is derived ABOVE the stale-base
update, and the update's gate refuses a parked PR beside the conflict
park: a base merge into a parked PR re-fires every synchronize-triggered
workflow on the new head, and the base-merge round reviews an unchanged
diff — its clean marker resets the streak, silently lifting the park
with zero human activity (af-108's exact hazard, the one the conflict
park's guard was added for). Both gates reuse the one derivation, so the
two reads cannot drift; the park ACTION sits ABOVE the idle fast-path —
a parked PR whose signal rounds all sit at or below the eval watermark IS
the idle case, and the notice and fleet row the action writes are the
park's only visible escalation, so below the fast-path they would never
be reached — and still precedes target emission, so a parked PR spends
no dispatch, no runner, and no round either way.
The notice's release clause branches on the takeover label like the cap
notices: `/takeover stop` is a logged no-op on a PR without the label,
so there the notice offers takeover itself instead. Its codes clause
claims exactly the union it prints — codes observed since the last
maintainer response, or the window start if none — because CONV_SINCE
advances to the newest trusted-human activity, not the window key.

The RELEASE census is the park's own enumeration: a posted notice holds
the park until the boundary itself moves (a trusted-human response or a
re-arm). Any clean round resets the streak — including the review a
maintainer push triggers via synchronize — but must not silently release
the park: the dedup counts notices newer than the boundary, so a
release-then-re-trip would re-park under the stale notice with no fresh
one. If the signal resumes, the streak census re-parks loudly (the
boundary moved, or the notice is still the newest word); the hold only
keeps the quiet middle honest. The mirror and the report guard carry the
same hold.

In `review-address` · `Prepare branch and feedback`.

```text
Convergence-break mirror (#10107): the scan refuses to select while the
breaker holds, but a target can be emitted moments before the tripping
review lands — the review's own pull_request_review trigger routes a
round for exactly the review that completes the streak — or forced past
the scan by dispatch. The leg therefore re-derives the same reading over
its own live fetch and idles via STALE, the same shape as the conflict
park above it and the live-watermark revalidation before it: discard
without action, marker, or comment. The notice stays the scan's job — a
leg that posted it would race the scan's dedup, and the once-per-boundary
guarantee is only checkable where the comment list and the decision live
in one place; the next scheduled scan (10-minute cron) posts it, so the
visible escalation lags the park by at most one scan interval.

Keep the two readings in LOCKSTEP with the scan gate (boundary, streak,
codes) — a divergence between them either burns agent rounds the scan
already refused, or silently discards rounds the scan still allows. A
test replays both against the same fixture. The mirror also carries the
scan's park HOLD: a target dispatched before a clean round reset the
streak must not land on a PR a posted notice still holds parked.

In `review-address` · `Report dry-run / failure`.

```text
Convergence-break report guard (#10122): the report step's stale-base
retry is a sibling wake leg the scan's CONV_PARKED cannot cover — that
reading is scan-local, and this job's inputs froze at prepare time. The
race: the scan emits a target while the streak is one short; the round
passes prepare's mirror before the tripping review lands; the scan parks
the PR on its next tick; the in-flight round then fails its verification
gate — and this step, POST_HANDOFF on a frozen STALE=false, merges main
into the parked PR. The merge re-fires every synchronize-triggered
workflow; the base-merge round reviews an unchanged diff and posts a
rec-less marker; the streak resets — the park lifts with zero human
activity, the notice's "base conflicts stay unhandled while paused"
promise broken, and no fresh notice because the boundary never moved.
The race window is the full prepare-to-report span — tens of minutes
against the 10-minute scan cadence — on exactly the PRs the breaker
targets.

The guard re-derives the breaker's reading over fresh fetches before the
merge attempt — the rearm key, the boundary, and the streak programs are
the scan gate's verbatim, and the park hold rides along, so the three
sites stay in one lockstep pin — and skips update-branch while the
reading holds, exactly like the conflict verdict's skip above it. A
skipped retry reports the gate failure honestly instead; the park's own
notice is still the scan's job.

### 155. review-address · Report dry-run / failure — Hold the stale-base refresh while a review-pr is in flight on the PR.

In `review-address` · `Report dry-run / failure`.

```text
The scan's dispatch gate (#8888/#8899) already refuses to start a round
while review-pr is live, but the loop had one more head-moving write
outside that hold: this step's stale-base retry calls update-branch at
REPORT time, hours after the dispatch gate last looked. A review can
start in that window — a human /review comment, a bot re-request, or a
run the scan's fail-open probe missed — and the merge push would then
supersede a lifecycle review run mid-flight (#10110; before the salvage
threshold that discards its work exactly as the old cancel did), or
invalidate a command run's posting: every review pins the head it
reviews (QWEN_CI_REVIEW_EXPECTED_HEAD_SHA) and its guard blocks the
final post when the head moved, so even the uncancellable per-run-group
reviews lose their whole run to a head move.

So the retry probes for a live review first, with the scan gate's probe
pair: the statusCheckRollup filter (any live review-pr check from the
review workflow), then the runs-API fallback for runs still parked in
the 10-minute delay window with no check-run yet. The probe sees
LIFECYCLE runs only: a command-triggered run executes against the base
branch, so its review-pr check attaches to main's commit and never
shows under the PR's rollup (the review ack comment says the same), and
the runs fallback is event-scoped to pull_request_target exactly like
the scan gate's (af-099). An in-flight command review therefore does
NOT hold the refresh, and the merge push can still invalidate its
posting — the second hazard named above, still open. Giving command
runs a PR-head-visible signal (a pending check posted at the ack step,
matched here) is the mechanism fix; it is deliberately deferred — it
needs a completion/TTL story for stranded pendings and a lockstep
decision with the scan gate, whose exclusion of command runs (R2-1)
this probe copies — so this text scopes the hold to what it actually
sees.
On a live review the update is DEFERRED, not skipped: the same 9999
sentinel MARK_TS the retry branch uses keeps the feedback live, the
next scan re-runs the round (itself held while the review is still in
flight), and that round's report step performs the refresh once the
review has landed. One extra round of latency, bounded by MAX_ROUNDS,
against hours of discarded review work. At the cap itself (MARK_ROUND ==
MAX_ROUNDS) the hold yields to the refresh: no later round exists to
inherit it, and a deferral there would promise a retry the scan's round
gate forbids — so the last permitted round refreshes the base exactly as
it did before #10110 (R32-1).

Fail-open on probe errors, deliberately: the probe is an optimization,
and failing closed would wedge stale-base recovery — the path that
un-sticks red PRs — on any transient API error. A probe error therefore
reads as "no review live" and the update proceeds, which is exactly the
pre-#10110 behavior. The deferred headline joins CONSEC_FAIL's
streak-reset needles ("deferred a stale-base refresh"): like the
updated-a-stale-base round it defers to, the round's failure is not
evidence about the PR, and counting it toward the cap would park a PR
for having been reviewed at the wrong moment.
```
