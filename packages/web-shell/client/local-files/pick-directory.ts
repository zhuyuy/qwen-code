/**
 * Grant acquisition and recovery for the local-files bridge.
 *
 * Two paths, because the browser splits them: `pickDirectoryHandle` needs a
 * user gesture and opens the native picker; `ensureReadwritePermission` reports
 * whether an already-stored handle can be used silently. Chrome may answer
 * `granted` after a reload (persistent permission) or `prompt`, and `prompt`
 * can only be cleared by another real gesture — `requestPermission()` consumes
 * the activation that a page load does not have. The UI therefore needs a
 * reconnect affordance even though the common case is silent.
