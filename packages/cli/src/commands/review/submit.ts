// `qwen review submit`: the only thing in this skill that writes to a pull
// request.
//
// Step 7 has always opened with a posting gate — "posting is a public,
// irreversible write, so it happens ONLY on an explicit instruction" — written
// as prose, and prose is not a gate. It has now failed twice in dogfooding. The
// second time was this skill reviewing its own pull request: no `--comment`, no
// publish request, and it filed a public COMMENT review anyway. Both times the
// model did not decide to defy the rule; it reasoned its way to a verdict it
// wanted to file and never re-read the sentence forbidding the filing.
//
// The skill already learned this once. The review event and body used to be
// reasoned about at submit time and got it wrong five times running, so they
// became `compose-review` — a subcommand that computes them. **Whether to write
// at all** is the same kind of decision, and the authorisation is already a
// computed fact: `parse-args` emits `comment.effective` in Step 1. Nothing was
// missing but a piece of code willing to say no.
//
// So the write lives here, behind that fact. A model that wants to post must ask
// something that checks.
//
// **And the verdict is no longer an input.** For a while, `compose-review`
// computed the event and the body and the skill then told the orchestrator to
// "copy event/body verbatim into the review JSON" — a transcription, into a
// document the model writes, of a decision the CLI had already made. That is the
// exact shape this file's own comment repudiates two paragraphs up, and it is the
// shape that has failed at every layer of this skill. Dogfooded, one run went
// further and skipped `compose-review` altogether: it read the coverage check's
// refusal, decided "the agents clearly did their job", and printed an **Approve it
// had written itself**.
//
// So `submit` composes. What it takes is the *findings* — the inline comments and
// the states Step 6 established — and it derives everything that follows from
// them, including how many blockers there are, by counting the comments actually
// attached rather than believing a number typed beside them. There is no `event`
// field to forge and no `body` field to write, and a payload that carries one is
// refused: the caller was trying to author a verdict, and the verdict is not the
// caller's.

  // Which PLATFORM this write lands on. Evidence precedence mirrors the

  // disciplines:
  //  - The predicate is the CANONICAL Aone pair, not the family wildcard:
  //    `*.alibaba-inc.com` also names GitHub Enterprise instances (an
  //    org's `ghe.alibaba-inc.com`), and an irreversible write must not
  //    take the a1 path on a family resemblance.
  //  - The ambient GH_HOST export is NEVER consulted here. It is a
  //    GitHub-ROUTING variable; a read would never detect Aone from it
  //    (detectPlatformKind does not read it), and a write that did could
  //    READ from one platform and WRITE to another.
  //  - The FAST path with no host evidence at all — a recording that
  //    names no host (a bare-MR-number recording without `--host`), or NO
  //    recording found (writeSkillArgs never throws, recordings are
  //    cwd-relative — a publish invoked from another directory finds
  //    nothing) — fails CLOSED and names the remedy (`--host`), which
  //    this gate honours: an explicit flag on the re-run is platform
  //    proof, so it lifts the refusal instead of meeting it again. The
  //    cwd probe may still decide a SLOW-path publish — that path reads
  //    the current session's own recording, so it is same-session by
  //    construction and the cwd names the clone the review ran in. The
  //    ONE slow-path shape that is not — a session-less caller reading a
  //    `--skill-args` override, another cwd's record — fails closed on
  //    its hostless form too: the probe names submit's clone there, not
  //    the review's.
  //  - An explicit `--host` and a recorded host are ONE evidence chain
  //    about where the reviewed target lives: the flag FILLS the gap
  //    when the recording names no host (the remedy above), it does not
  //    override the recording's answer. Two hosts that are not the same
  //    platform (through hostsEquivalent, so the Aone web/git alias
  //    passes) name a contradiction — the review ran on one, and the
  //    write would land on the other's same-named repo — so the gate
  //    refuses instead of choosing. The recorded host is the user's own
  //    keystrokes; a caller-typed flag is not entitled to retarget it.
  // The recorded host is the operator's VERBATIM keystrokes, but every
  // discriminating read below assumes the trimmed spelling — trim ONCE
  // here so a padded canonical host is still recognised as Aone and a
  // trim-equivalent flag cannot conflict with its own recording. An
