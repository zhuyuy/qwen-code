// `qwen review parse-args`: deterministic argument parsing for the /review
// skill. The flag grammar (`--comment`, `--effort <level>`, `--effort=<level>`)
// and the target disambiguation (PR number / PR URL / file path / local diff)
// used to live as prose in SKILL.md, which the model re-simulated on every
// run; three separate parsing bugs shipped that way. This module is the
// single source of truth: the skill passes the raw argument string in and
// uses the JSON verdict verbatim.
//
// Scope: pure argument classification only. Anything that needs repo state —
// matching a PR URL's owner/repo against `git remote -v`, checking that a
// file path exists — stays with the caller.

  //   mistake, and an unrelated second typo (`--severity-floor blocker

  // - File-shaped survives only as the SOLE kept token (`/review
  //   --severity-floor criticl`): beside anything else, `blocker` is an
  //   enum typo, not a path — promoting it would send the caller off to
  //   stat nonsense, and two such typos are two typos, not a target and a
  //   tiebreak.

  // when one exists, every invalid value is a typo beside the real target.

  // invalid flag values (`--severity-floor 6711 --effort 6712`) are an
