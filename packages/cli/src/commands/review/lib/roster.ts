// Which agents this review is required to launch, derived from the plan.
//
// "Which agents must exist" was, until now, a sentence in a document. The skill
// says Agent 0 runs on every PR review; dogfooded against a real PR, **it was
// never launched**, and nothing in the run could tell — the coverage check asks
// what the agents that *did* run were given, and an agent that does not run leaves
// no transcript to ask. An omission is invisible precisely because it is an
// omission. The only cure is a list of who should have been there, written by
// something other than the thing doing the launching.
//
// The plan is that something. It already knows everything the roster turns on:
// the topology (from `srcDiffLines` / `diffLines`), whether the diff deletes
// anything (so whether the removed-behaviour audit has a job), which files were
// rewritten heavily enough to need whole-file invariant agents, and — from the
// fields the capturing command wrote — whether there is a pull request to check an
// issue against and a local tree to build and grep.
//
// Nothing here is supplied by the caller. A roster the caller could shrink is a
// roster that gets shrunk.
