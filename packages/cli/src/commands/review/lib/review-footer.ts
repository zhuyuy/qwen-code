/**
 * One structural pass over the body, shared by every line-aware strip and
 * the blanking: which lines GitHub renders as code (the quotations the
 * maps keep and the blanking hides), which as visible HTML-block content,
 * and which as ordinary text the maps apply to — classified identically
 * everywhere.
 *
 * The classification is the CommonMark parser's token map, not a hand
 * model of the block grammar. The scan this replaced tracked fences and
 * HTML blocks itself and disagreed with the renderers on lazy continuation
 * (an indented line right after a paragraph line is prose, not code), on
 * list content indents and tab stops, and on fence delimiters inside a
 * raw-HTML block — each disagreement kept a forged footer the render
 * showed, or hid one it rendered as code. A fence token's map covers its
 * delimiters too, so they classify with their content. Blockquotes and
 * list items are the parser's containers: a `> ```` quotation of an earlier
 * round's comment (`quoteBlock` in pr-context) is code at its depth.
 *
 * Tag-based HTML blocks (`<div>`, `<details>`, `<pre>` …) render their
 * content visibly, so it maps like text — the one droppable quotation kind
 * — and is what the marker-exposure gate counts. The raw kinds (a comment,
 * PI, declaration or CDATA block) render nothing; they were never modeled
 * and classify as text, where the projection's own comment handling
 * applies.
 *
 * Blockquote-wrapped lines keep their prefix on `line`, their content on
 * `content`, and their prefix depth on `depth`: the maps match quoted
 * shapes at any depth, and a paragraph run ends where the depth changes.
 *
 * Splits on every CommonMark line ending — `\n`, `\r\n`, and a bare
 * `\r`: the parser normalizes all three to one line break, so its map and
 * this split stay aligned, and the CR twins of these bodies classify like
 * the LF ones.
