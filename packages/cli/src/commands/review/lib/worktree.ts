 * `includeIf.<cond>.path` those files carry — and the files it could not
 * read. Empty on both counts means: every candidate was read to the bottom
 * and none defines a filter command.
 *
 * Two git invocations in this pipeline EXECUTE these — hooks and fsmonitor
 * are blanked by key name, filters cannot be blanked BLIND, because their
 * key carries a name of the planter's choosing. The scratch-tree checkouts
 * run the smudge side of an attributed file; the residue `status` runs the
 * clean side (or the `process` filter that serves both) when a stat-stale
 * attributed file refreshes the index — measured live through the exact
 * residue invocation on git 2.43 and 2.47, and the tree still reported
 * clean. The planting surface is two plain writes into the common dir the
 * scratch-tree report calls shared: `git config filter.evil.clean CMD` and
 * one line appended to `$(git rev-parse --git-path info/attributes)`.
 * discard and cleanup never wipe the common dir, so a filter planted while
 * reviewing one PR fires on every later matching checkout of the user's OWN
 * repository — persistence planted by reviewing a malicious PR, measured
 * live. The local config files are read with `--file` rather than merged
 * config because filters in the user's global config (git-lfs is the common
 * one) are the user's own contract, exactly like any git command they run —
 * while a probe's planting surface is the repo-local files. The state cannot
 * be told apart from a filter the user set deliberately, and cannot be
 * safely wiped, so what the caller does with a hit is the caller's: the
 * scratch-tree checkouts refuse, the residue measurement blanks the names
 * it was handed. And it is a one-shot read of same-user-writable state, like
 * every gate in this file: cost, not closure.
 *
 * Includes are followed by hand because `--file` does not expand them, and
 * an include is the one indirection that delivers every other key: a
 * planter commits `[filter "evil"] clean = …` in an innocuous file and adds
 * one `include.path` line to the repo-local config, and a `--file` read
 * lists the directive while the `status` refresh runs the command
 * (measured). Each target is resolved the way git resolves it — `~/`
 * against `$HOME`, a relative path against the directory of the path git
 * OPENED for the including file (its spelled path, not its realpath: a
 * symlinked `.git/config` includes beside the link, measured) — and read
 * with the same single spawn, recursively, under a visited set keyed by
 * realpath, git's own nesting limit, and this screen's file cap. An
 * `includeIf` is followed whether or not its condition holds today: the
 * screen answers what the file can deliver, not what it delivers this
 * minute. Every spawn runs with the common dir as cwd, so a target that
 * lives outside the repository never makes git discover a repository in a
 * foreign directory (a dangling gitfile there exits 128 — measured — and
 * would read as a file this screen could not read).
 *
 * Bounded like the other planter-sized reads here: the listing's size is
 * the config file's, which is the planter's to write, and past Node's 1 MiB
 * default `spawnSync` answers ENOBUFS with no stdout — a `continue` on that
 * read the file as filter-free while the refresh ran the planted command
 * (measured at 1.01 MiB). So the spawn carries the house `maxBuffer`, and a
 * read that fails for ANY reason lands in `unread`, never in "no filters".
 *
 * Every linked worktree's per-worktree config is a candidate too, not only
 * the two files git reads for THIS tree: the scratch-tree screen runs
 * against the review worktree while the checkout it authorises runs in the
 * SCRATCH tree, whose own `<common>/worktrees/<label>/config.worktree` is
 * honored once `extensions.worktreeConfig` is on — a filter planted there
 * executed during the reset while a narrower screen reported the repository
 * clean. The admin directory is one `readdir`, and a filter in any of these
 * is a plant whichever tree carries it.

 * The paths a tree carries that its HEAD commit does not — probe residue, seen

 *
 * A review worktree is a pristine detached checkout of the PR head, and every
 * build artifact the review produces there is gitignored, so in a healthy run
 * this is empty. What it catches is the one thing that is neither: a file some
 * agent wrote into the shared tree, or a line it edited there, while the
 * pipelined loop had another agent reading the same tree. Named paths, not a
 * boolean — "the tree is dirty" tells a reader nothing it can act on, whereas
 * "these three paths are not in the commit" tells it exactly which of its
 * evidence to distrust.
 *
 * Three flags decide whether the names are usable, and every one of them was
 * wrong in the first cut:
 *
 * - `-z` because the names become COMMANDS. Porcelain's rendered form quotes a
 *   path with spaces or non-ASCII bytes (`"caf\303\251.ts"`) and writes a
 *   rename as `orig -> new`, so a file literally named `a -> b.ts` parsed to
 *   `b.ts"` — a name matching nothing on disk, handed to an agent as the path
 *   to run `git show HEAD:` against. The NUL format is unquoted and puts a
 *   rename's original path in its own record.
 * - `--untracked-files=all` because `normal` collapses a new directory to one
 *   `probe_dir/` entry, and every recovery this pipeline prints — `git show
 *   HEAD:`, `git checkout HEAD --` — fails on a directory. The contamination
 *   shape this exists to catch (an agent dropping probe files into a new
 *   folder) is exactly the shape `normal` renders unactionable. One directory
 *   shape survives the flag: git will not recurse into an untracked directory
 *   that holds its own `.git`, so a cloned fixture still arrives as a single
 *   `dir/` entry — detected and disclosed, but recoverable only by `rm -rf`,
 *   which is what both renderers tell the reader to use for untracked residue.
 * - `maxBuffer` because the default is 1 MB and `spawnSync` answers ENOBUFS by
 *   returning no stdout — which this function would have read as "clean". The
 *   overload case is the one where the tree is dirtiest.
 *
 * Ignored files are excluded, and the pipeline's own build artifacts
 * (`node_modules`, `dist`) are excluded even when the COMMIT under review
 * does not ignore them: the review builds in this tree, and a PR whose
 * `.gitignore` does not cover its install used to turn that install into
 * residue — every verifier's first act aimed at deleting the very tree its
 * farm borrows from.
 *
 * The tree's identity is checked before its state: git's repository discovery
 * walks UP, so a directory whose `.git` file is gone answers `git status`
 * with the enclosing user checkout's dirty state — the wrong tree, measured
 * silently, and the restore recipe this probe triggers aimed at the user's
 * own files. That shape fails closed instead. So does a repository PLANTED at
 * the path — `rm .git && git init && git add -A && git commit` conceals any
 * contamination under a clean status — because no local check can tell a
 * planted repo from the tree it replaced: a genuine review worktree holds its
 * `.git` as a gitFILE naming its admin entry, and anything else is refused as
 * unmeasured rather than certified clean. Two further shapes fail closed on
 * the same principle. A symlink at the tree path or any ancestor redirects
 * every check into territory holding a completely genuine worktree pair
 * with the contamination committed — all of it resolving through the link
 * and agreeing with itself — so a path reached through a link is refused.
 * The walk that finds one stops at the repository the common dir belongs to
 * where that contains the tree; where it does not — a review worktree under
 * a checkout that is itself a linked worktree, a `--separate-git-dir`
 * clone — git puts no constraint on where a linked worktree lives, so the
 * walk lstats every component up to the filesystem root instead, and the
 * round trip and the sha pin below hold the layout. And a FORGED admin
 * entry — hand-written to name this tree back, which the round trip
 * cannot tell from the entry `worktree add` wrote — is refused when the
 * caller supplies the commit the tree must hold:
 * a forge carrying the contamination as committed content cannot also
 * reproduce the fetched head sha, so a pinned `rev-parse HEAD` disagreeing
 * with the caller's record is a refusal. The record arrives read from disk,
 * so it raises the plant's cost rather than making planting impossible.
 * Callers without any record still get residue NAMED — a forge answers
 * clean, never dirty, so dirty readings still point at the tree — but
 * never a verdict: without the record nothing separates the tree from a
 * forged pair whose index already holds the contamination as committed
 * content, so the measurement is refused as unmeasured, the paths
 * retained for the reader to act on.
 *
 * One blind spot the identity checks cannot close: `git status` never looks
 * INSIDE a committed gitlink (mode 160000), and untracked content there does
 * not dirty it — so a tree carrying submodules is measured for everything
 * except what those paths hold. When a gitlink's directory is non-empty, the
 * answer is unmeasured naming the path, never clean.
 *
 * Empty on any git failure: this is a diagnostic, and a diagnostic that throws
 * would fail the build it is only commenting on.
 *
 * One limit the NUL format does not remove: `encoding: 'utf8'` maps an invalid
 * UTF-8 byte in a filename to U+FFFD, so such a path is reported but no longer
 * resolves on disk. No string form of it can — Node's fs API takes strings here
 * — so the name is disclosed as git rendered it rather than silently dropped.

 *
 * The root farm is not the whole job in a monorepo. npm hoists what it can, but
 * a version conflict leaves packages installed under the MEMBER
 * (`packages/cli/node_modules`), and Node resolves those by walking up from the
 * importing file — so a tree with only the root farm fails to resolve exactly

 * tree with 1 560 root packages linked still could not resolve
 * `@testing-library/react` for a UI probe, because that copy lives under

 * members the disposable tree actually contains.
 *
 * Best-effort per entry, and deliberately so: one locked or concurrently

 * lands in the dependency root's copy, which is the shared review worktree, and

 * farm instead would cost the minutes the farm exists to save, so the contract
 * is stated rather than enforced: the tree's own files are yours, its
 * dependencies are borrowed, and a probe that needs to modify a dependency must
 * replace the LINK with a copy rather than write through it. The verifier's
 * brief says the same in the words it acts on.

 * The reason a disposable worktree could not be created.
 *
 * The stale-sweep's stderr is folded in because it is usually the explanation:
 * when `add` fails on a leftover the sweep could not clear, the sweep is what
 * says why. Pure, and extracted for that reason — the branch it lives on fires
 * only when `git worktree add` fails, and there is no portable way to force that
 * in a real-git test (the one lever, making `.git/worktrees` unwritable, is
 * bypassed by root and behaves differently under CI's unprivileged user).
