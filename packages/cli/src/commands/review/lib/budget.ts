//
// The roster answers *which dimensions* a review owes and is deliberately
// size-blind: security is owed on a four-line diff exactly as on a four-hundred
// one. What the roster does not answer is *how much walking* the size-elastic
// parts of the run should do — the low tier's angle rotation, the optional
// domain specialists, the verifier's shard width. Those were flat constants, and
// a flat constant is wrong at both ends: seven inline walks over a nine-line
// typo fix is six walks of nothing, and "up to 2 specialists when a domain
// dominates" invites a domain-dominance ruling on a diff far too small to have
// one.
//
// Two properties, both borrowed from how `effort` already works here:
//
//  1. **It lives in the plan, not in a flag.** A budget the caller passes is a
//     budget the caller can inflate — and every reader (the orchestrator running
//     the angles, anything that later checks what was owed) must see the same
//     number, or they disagree about what the run promised.
//
//  2. **It never scales a *dimension* away.** Everything below tunes how much
//     the elastic parts do. No arm of it can drop a required agent: that is the
//     roster's job, the roster reads `effort`, and a size input must not become
//     a back door into shrinking coverage.

 * is cut to the shorter tier, never the reverse. What that
 * buys, stated as what actually happens rather than as a slogan:
 *
 *  - **A hand-edited plan cannot cross tiers.** The field is CLI-written and
 *    nothing here is the caller's to override; clamping to the tier means a
 *    `reverseAuditRounds: 10` typed into a 5,800-line plan buys nothing,
 *    which a single upper bound of ten would have honoured.
 *  - **A plan with no `reverseAuditRounds` at all** — a pre-budget CLI's —
 *    reads as its topology's tier instead of one flat number.
 *
 * Two things this does NOT do, both of which an earlier draft of this comment
 * claimed and the code never did:
 *
 *  - It does **not** upgrade a legacy small plan to ten. A CLI that predates
 *    tiering wrote `reverseAuditRounds: 5`, and 5 is inside a 3A plan's
 *    `[3, 10]` band, so it is honoured as 5. Only an absent or out-of-band
 *    value ever reaches the tier. Migrating in-band values would mean
 *    overriding a number the plan states, which is the one thing a reader of
 *    a CLI-written field must not do.
 *  - It does **not** always err toward more auditing. A field-less **huge**
 *    plan reads 3 where the flat fallback read 5 — deliberately less — but
 *    only in a run that has a deadline; without one the huge tier is 5 and the
 *    fallback is unchanged. The reduction is a finishability ruling, and the
 *    reviews it exists for are the ones that ran six hours and posted nothing.
 *
 * The range stays floored at `HUGE_REVERSE_AUDIT_ROUNDS`, the smallest cap
 * the CLI ever writes. A value of one or two is out of band (a hand-edited
 * plan): one cannot reach convergence at all, and two leaves no round for a
 * loop that reports anything — see `cappedRoundTier` for why neither buys a
 * cheaper review. Both fall back to the tier, never less.

/**
 * The disclosure an agent writes when the ceiling stopped a check, and the
 * one parser every reader of that disclosure shares. The brief mandates the
 * line form (`Budget gap: <the check>`); `check-coverage` reports the
 * parsed gaps; the reverse-audit retirement strips these lines out of a
 * receipt before judging its substance. One matcher, one home — a second
 * copy is how the brief and its readers drift apart.
 *
 * The scan is LINE-BASED, three reviews' worth of reasons at once:
 *
 *  - A single multiline regex whose prefix class could cross `\n` was
 *    measured at seconds-per-run on pathological-but-ordinary returns
 *    (quoted diff hunks, banner comments) — quadratic backtracking from
 *    every line start. Per-line matching cannot cross lines, so it cannot
 *    backtrack across them.
 *  - The gap must sit on the SAME line as its marker: a bare
 *    `Budget gap:` header used to swallow the following line, turning an
 *    explicit next-line denial into a phantom disclosure.
 *  - QUOTING the format must not read as USING it: lines inside fenced
 *    code blocks and blockquote lines are skipped — this repo reviews its
 *    own PRs, and a reviewer of this very diff quotes these strings. (The
 *    same hazard transcripts.ts guards for tool-call parsing.) Bullets and
 *    numbering stay tolerated: lists are how an agent writes its own
 *    disclosures, and a disclosure lost to a bullet is unobservable —
 *    nothing downstream can tell "no gaps" from "gaps we failed to parse".
 */
// Linear-by-construction, for the same reason the scan is line-based: the
// bullet's leading whitespace rides INSIDE the optional group (no
// overlapping `[ \t]*` pair), and the gap capture is greedy to the end of
// a pre-trimmed line (no lazy-dot vs trailing-whitespace pair) — gap lines
// carrying long whitespace runs must not stall the parse.

/**
 * Templates and non-answers that must not become gaps someone rules on —
 * the agent saying it has nothing to disclose. A phantom gap costs real
 * rounds downstream (a chunk that never retires, a body that discloses
 * "None." on an Approve), so these shapes are dropped.
 *
 * One classifier judges the paren-stripped text, bare and wrapped alike:
 * #8388's posted body disclosed `(none — all planned checks completed)`
 * because a leading `(` defeated the match, and a bare-vs-wrapped split
 * judgment let the two forms diverge on identical content. The vocabulary
 * lives in this one regex for the same reason.
 *
 * The shapes are deliberately NARROW, because the two errors are not
 * symmetric: dropping a REAL gap certifies work that never happened (the
 * failure #8388's body shipped), while keeping a placeholder only
 * over-discloses. Anything outside them survives as a gap:
 *
 *  - the brief's own `<the check>` template, and dash-only text — both
 *    end-anchored, so inner text merely STARTING with them keeps;
 *  - a bare placeholder token in any trailing punctuation (`none`,
 *    `None.`, `no gaps`), and the non-answer idioms `nothing skipped`,
 *    `none found`, `nothing to report`;
 *  - the stayed-under-budget idiom, end-anchored like its siblings
 *    (`N/A - stayed under budget`), with the same position words and
 *    budget qualifiers as the completion tail below (`stayed inside the
 *    tool-call budget`) — one vocabulary for one idiom family; text
 *    continuing past `budget` keeps (`N/A - stayed under budget, but the
 *    Windows matrix never ran`);
 *  - the completion idiom — token, dash, an "all done" head, then a
 *    completion word the text ENDS with (`none — all planned checks
 *    completed`), tolerating one trailing budget adverbial (`none — all
 *    checks above completed within budget` — three of these reached two
 *    posted bodies in one live round because the completion word was not
 *    final). The head alone is not completion (`none — all 5
 *    Windows checks failed to start` keeps), the completion word must be
 *    AFFIRMED (`none — all checks crashed, none completed` keeps), and
 *    the span must not cross an exception (`none — all but the Windows
 *    checks completed` keeps);
 *  - a token followed by a parenthesized completion clause (`None (all
 *    checks completed)`), inner padding tolerated — under the same
 *    negation and exception guards.
 *
 * No two quantifiers overlap on whitespace: a placeholder token followed
 * by a long whitespace run must stay linear (the module header's hazard
 * note applies — this parse runs on every agent return). The completion
 * spans are tempered (a per-character exception lookahead), which keeps
 * them linear too.

 * The same non-answer, written in Chinese.
 *
 * The line DETECTOR above has always been bilingual (`预算缺口` and the
 * full-width colon are in `GAP_HINT_RE`), but this classifier was not — so
 * under `general.outputLanguage: 中文` an agent's "nothing to disclose" became
 * a real gap. Measured on a live review of PR #9094: a reverse-audit agent
 * returned `Budget gap: 无 — 所有检查均完成，未触及工具预算上限。` ("none — all
 * checks completed, the tool budget was NOT reached") and the composed body
 * published `Not explored to full depth (tool budget reached)` quoting that
 * very sentence — the disclosure asserted the opposite of its own evidence.
 *
 * **The completion clause is a CLOSED VOCABULARY, not a span with exclusions.**
 * That is the whole design, and it is the second attempt: the first cut spelled
 * the clause as bounded `.{0,40}` spans that merely refused to cross `但`/`除`,
 * and two rounds of live review walked straight through it — a negation the
 * one-character lookbehind could not see (`还没有完成`, `未能完成`, `难以完成`),
 * a gap clause the span swallowed before the completion word
 * (`3 项未运行，其余完成`) or after it (`安全检查完成，渗透测试未进行`), and a
 * span that slid past a NEGATED completion to a later affirmed one. Every one
 * of those is the unsafe direction: this module's header states the asymmetry —
 * dropping a REAL gap certifies work that never happened, keeping a
 * placeholder only over-discloses.
 *
 * A closed vocabulary cannot be walked through, because there is nothing to
 * walk: the clause matches only if the ENTIRE text after the token is built
 * from these pieces, so any sentence carrying an actual gap simply fails to
 * match and is kept. Adding a phrase is a deliberate edit to this list, not a
 * side effect of loosening a quantifier.
 *
 * Shapes:
 *
 *  - a bare token (`无`, `没有`, `不适用`), optionally with the noun the brief
 *    uses (`无缺口`, `没有跳过的检查`);
 *  - a token, one separator, then the closed completion clause
 *    (`无 — 所有检查均完成`), optionally with one budget adverbial
 *    (`，未触及工具预算上限`).
 *
 * The token needs an explicit boundary — Chinese has no `\b`. `无` is a prefix
 * of `无法…` ("unable to…"), which is a REAL gap and must survive, so a token
 * is only a token when what follows it is punctuation, whitespace, a
 * separator, or the end of the text.
