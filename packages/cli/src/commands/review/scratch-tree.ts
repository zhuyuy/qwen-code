// `qwen review scratch-tree`: a private copy of the PR head for one verifier to
// mutate, so the tree everyone else is READING stays exactly as the PR left it.
//
// Step 4's verifier was the last review step still writing into the shared tree
// (Agent 7's efficacy probe has had a disposable sibling since #6832): it
// writes a probe, runs it, applies the one-line fix the finding implies to show
// the probe flips, and restores. Until now it did all of that in the shared
// review worktree — the tree `working_dir` pins every other agent to as well.
//
// That is a race, and the pipeline's own shape is what makes it structural
// rather than unlucky: round k's verifiers are launched in the SAME response as
// round k+1's reverse auditors ("Verification rides alongside the next round"),
// so a verifier's probe is live in the tree precisely while auditors read it.
// Measured on a real review (#9207): a round-5 auditor read `compose-review.ts`
// carrying a probe's mutant plus a leftover `__probe__.test.ts`, and came within
// a step of filing a Critical against code no commit contains. It recovered by
// improvising `git show HEAD:` — a fallback no brief mentions. Two other agents
// in the same run reported the residue.
//
// "Leave the tree as you found it" — which the verifier brief has always said,
// and which verifiers do obey — cannot close this: the exposure window is DURING
// the probe, not after it. The only fix that removes the window is a tree of
// one's own, which is the pattern this pipeline already uses twice: the
// test-efficacy probe's `-probe` sibling (#6832) and the A/B's `-base` sibling.
// This is the third, and the last mutating step that lacked one.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: run anything. Like `base-tree`, it owns the
// fiddly half — a detached add at the right SHA, a leftover from a crashed run,
// a dependency farm so a unit harness can actually start — and hands back a
// path. WHAT to probe is the verifier's question, and no fixed scenario fits it.
//
// Two shapes of tree, chosen by the caller. The verifier's is a LINKED
// worktree: fast to reset, and its `.git` is a pointer into the user's own
// repository — hooks, config and refs are shared, which the report says
// plainly and the verifier brief treats as out of bounds. `--standalone` is
// for an agent whose INPUT is untrusted — the prose-execution audit executes
// instructions the PR author wrote — and it is a repository of its own: a
// fresh `git init` whose object store is the user's, reached through an
// alternates pointer, checked out at the reviewed head. Whatever a recipe
// step writes into that tree's config, hooks, refs or index lands there and
// dies with the tree — the STATE does. A command-valued key written there
// (`core.hooksPath`, `core.fsmonitor`, a `filter.*`, an `alias.*`) is live
// at the next git command run IN the tree, as the reviewer — `git config
// core.hooksPath .githooks`, a committed hook, then `git commit` ran the
// hook, measured — and that reach is the brief's to judge, step by step,
// not this command's to screen. And nothing that could execute the user's repo-local
// config is run in their repository to build it: no clone (a local `git
// clone` spawns `upload-pack` in the SOURCE repository), no `worktree add`,
// no checkout, no index refresh, no residue `status` — the standalone
// shape's git in the user's repository is the `rev-parse` reads both shapes
// make, the checkout's object reads through the alternates file, and, when a
// LINKED tree from an earlier call stands at the path, the unregistration
// the linked shape would make. So the repo-local config screen below, which guards the
// git this command runs in the user's repository for the LINKED shape (its
// checkouts and the residue measurement), has nothing to guard for a
// standalone tree, and the standalone path returns before it — reporting the
// shared tree as unmeasured, never as clean. That shape is the lesson of its
// own history: every attempt to make a tree that SHARED the user's `.git`
// safe for untrusted input grew a screen over the shared surface, and no
// such screen closed — the surface is git-defined and grows across versions,
// its inputs are same-user-writable, and it refused the config state the
// pipeline's own CI checkout writes. A tree that shares nothing but an
// object store needs none.
//
// What neither shape is: a sandbox against the agent itself. A same-user
// process — and the agent IS one — can aim git at any path (`git -C`, a
// `git push <path>`, `git config --global`), and nothing in this file can
// tell that apart from the user doing it. The contract here is where writes
// made INSIDE the tree land; the briefs, not this command, forbid the rest.
// For the same reason no check here races a same-user process: a symlink
// swapped in between two of this command's syscalls is that process, and a
// gate against it certifies nothing.
