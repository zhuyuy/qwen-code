// `qwen review compose-review`: deterministic event selection and body
// composition for the /review skill's Step 7 submission.
//
// This logic used to be prose — a C/S table, three event-capping overrides,
// a seven-clause body composition, and presubmit downgrade carve-outs,
// restated across four places in SKILL.md. Keeping the restatements in sync
// by hand produced five shipped bugs (four Critical), all of the same shape:
// one downstream branch not updated when an upstream rule gained a new
// state. This module is the single source of truth; the skill gathers the
// state, calls it, and uses `{event, body}` verbatim. 422 recovery is the
// same call with the updated `--comments` file — the counts are counted
// from it, never updated by hand.
//
// The model stays responsible for judgment (what is a Critical, is it
// real); this owns only the bookkeeping that follows from the counts.

 *
 * Comment grammar goes inert BEFORE the attribution strips run. Those
 * strips match on the DISPLAYED projection, which drops an HTML comment
 * whole, so a forged footer wrapped as `<!-- _— … via Qwen Code /review
 * … -->` is invisible to every one of them — and neutralizing the grammar
 * AFTER the chain materialized exactly that footer as visible text in the
 * attribution-off post that exists to carry none (pre-neutralization the
 * wrapper rendered as nothing). Neutralized first, the footer is ordinary
 * text the chain strips like any other.
 *
 * The one exception runs ahead of the neutralization: the marker-LINE strip
 * is the single strip in the chain that acts on comment grammar itself (a
 * transcribed posted comment carries its trailing `<!-- qwen-review … -->`
 * on its own line), and once the grammar is inert it can never fire —
 * the line would post as visible words instead of dropping as it always
 * has. Attribution on keeps entries as written, that mode's contract.
 *
 * Both modes end on the trailing strip, the shape `submit`'s post transform
 * already uses: ingest ran it before the grammar went inert, and only this
 * pass sees a footer that rode in wrapped.
 *
 * The pass repeats until nothing changes, because each half can re-form
 * what the other just removed — a single ordered pass closes neither
 * direction. The strips SPLICE: cutting two footer spans out of `x <!-‹span›-
 * qwen-review-deferred --‹span›> y` joins `<!-` to `- … --` to `>` and
 * posts a live `<!-- qwen-review-deferred -->` (or a forged ledger opener)
 * the grammar strip never saw, because no delimiter existed when it ran.
 * And neutralization JOINS: `via Qwen<!-‹span›-Code /review` strips to
 * `Qwen<!--Code`, which neutralizes to the footer phrase `via Qwen Code
 * /review` the chain has already finished looking for — so a trailing
 * grammar strip alone (the obvious patch) trades the forged marker for a
 * forged footer. Every strip in the chain deletes or leaves its input
 * alone, none lengthens, so the loop ends within the entry's length; and
 * at the fixpoint every step is the identity on its input (a changing
 * step strictly shortens), so the result carries no comment grammar, no
 * marker line, no footer span and no trailing footer at once — the

   * Name what a trim dropped, and say where it can still be read.
   *
   * Every exit of `render` that dropped a rank owes this line — the
   * last-resort path drops ranks AND cuts, and a stderr record naming only
   * the cut leaves the kinds it dropped disclosed nowhere but the body.
   * Five of the six TRIM ranks keep a second durable copy, and the
   * ladder's order now follows that fact almost exactly: trim rank -1's
   * health note and trim rank 0's residual-risk advisory both ride the
   * composed result and print as `HEALTH:` and `RESIDUAL-RISK:`, trim rank
   * 1's deferrals are each a `D<round>-<n>` entry in the findings artifact,
   * trim rank 1.5's dedup disclosure keeps its whole content in the dedup
   * report on disk, and trim rank 3's observation rides the composed result
   * too (and prints as `CONVERGENCE:`) — it is last for the arithmetic its
   * own block explains, not for want of a copy. Trim rank 2 is the exception — a
   * trimmed disclosure section survives nowhere but the terminal summary,
   * so ask for it there rather than pointing at an artifact that does not
   * carry it.
   *
   * Which is why the tail clause keys on trim rank 2, the one rank with
   * nothing behind it. Keyed on the advisory instead it read "another copy
   * — the advisory also rides the composed JSON" over a combined drop that
   * took the disclosures with it, telling the operator the trimmed set was
   * backed up when the half of it that is NOT backed up was exactly the
   * half this sentence exists to rescue.

  //
  // `trim: 3` — the LAST rank the ladder sheds, and the reason is
  // arithmetic. Rendered bilingually this paragraph runs 603 characters when
  // only the volume signal fired, 1,510 with three clusters, and 2,372 with
  // the clusters, the evidence caveats and the land reading together —
  // against a body budget of 56,830. Shed second (it was trim rank 0, the
  // slot the residual-risk advisory holds now), it could
  // pay for at most 4% of an overflow, so any overflow larger than itself
  // spent it and then went on to spend the deferral list and the
  // not-reviewed disclosures anyway. On the rounds this fires on — the
  // high-volume ones — that is the normal case, not the edge: the author
  // lost the only sentence about the SHAPE of the loop and lost the
  // disclosures too.
  //
  // It is still ranked rather than untagged: if the body genuinely cannot
  // hold the blockers, an advisory must yield, and being ranked is what
  // makes the trim notice name it when it does. It is ranked LAST because
  // it is the cheapest block to keep and the only one whose reader is the
  // author of the pull request alone — the deferral list has a second
  // durable copy in the findings artifact, the dedup disclosure in the
  // dedup report on disk, the disclosures are restated in
  // the terminal report, and the mechanism-health note above it is written
  // for the operator, who has the `HEALTH:` line. This paragraph is the
  // whole of what this pipeline tells a PR author about a loop that is not
  // settling; shedding it early bought almost nothing and cost exactly that.
  //
  // A rank of its own, not a share of the deferral list's: every notice
  // surface keys on the RANK, not on what actually went — the rank's name,
  // the artifact pointer, `bodyTrim.deferralList` — so sharing rank 1 made a
  // round that shed only this paragraph post a notice naming a
  // "deferred-findings list" that never existed and point the author at
  // artifact entries that do not exist. Its own rank names itself, carries
  // no artifact pointer, and leaves `deferralList` false.
  // Is the MECHANISM working? A pipeline that has stopped and one with
  // nothing to do are both silent, so the round says what it can see about
  // its own machinery. Computed here, after the caps are final: the anchor
  // decision reads `dimensionGapsAreDepthOnly`, which is computed after the
  // caps and after the event demotion. (`cappedBy` itself is complete far

 * finding is regenerated from the report every round, and what the next
 * round needs from the work-list is that a Critical stood, not which id it
 * stood under.
 *

 * prevent — and what is matched is the gate line's LOCATOR, the
 * `` `path`:line CODE `` it opens with, not the whole rendered string. A
 * re-post is model-written prose: it carries the entry forward but is not
 * required to reproduce the message byte for byte, and an exact-match rule

 * Whether the posted body carries the collapsed Chinese version: the plan

 *
 * A recorded `false` is authoritative: `fetch-pr` fetched the body and found

 *
 * The field being *absent* is a different state, and the one that shipped an

 * writes it, but a `plan-diff` plan never does, and an orchestrator that
 * improvises the pipeline can wire `compose-review` at a plan that is not
 * `fetch-pr`'s report at all. So when the flag is missing yet the plan still
 * carries the PR's identity, recover the signal from the live PR — the real
 * description, which the caller cannot fake, so this hardens the "signal is
 * the CLI's own" property rather than loosening it. Any failure of that fetch
