 * Startup-time worktree setup for the `--worktree` CLI flag (Phase D-1).
 *
 * Runs after argv parsing and before `loadCliConfig()` / `Config` construction
 * so the resulting `process.cwd()` change feeds directly into the Config's
 * `targetDir`. Three entry forms are supported (see {@link setupStartupWorktree}):
 *
 * - Empty string (bare `--worktree`) → auto-generated `{adj}-{noun}-{6hex}` slug
 * - Plain slug (`--worktree my-feature`) → that exact slug
 * - PR reference (`--worktree=#123`, `--worktree https://github.com/o/r/pull/123`)
 *   → slug `pr-<N>`, fetched via `git fetch origin pull/<N>/head` and based
 *   off `FETCH_HEAD` (Phase D-3).
 *
 * Sidecar writing and `--resume` override accounting are NOT handled here —
 * those need a constructed `Config` and live in {@link persistStartupWorktreeSidecar}.
