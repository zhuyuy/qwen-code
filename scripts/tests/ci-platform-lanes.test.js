// The macOS and Windows lanes, and the gate that decides when they run.
//
// They were gated on `merge_group` alone while no merge queue was enabled, so
// they had not run since 2026-07-02: reported as "skipped" on every pull
// request — which reads as agreement — and never reached afterwards. The
// repository's only non-Linux, non-GNU signal was silently off, and a macOS
// failure shipped and sat in `main` (#9220). Nothing here can prove a lane
// ran; what these tests hold is the wiring that lets it: the triggers, the
// nightly's blast radius, and the alerting that makes a nightly failure
// visible.
//
// The pull-request trigger and its platform-sensitivity classifier are OFF
// while the standing Windows failures are being fixed (see the note above
// test_macos in ci.yml): on pull requests the Windows lane was reporting
// failures on every PR for defects no PR caused, and neither lane gates a
// merge. That leaves the nightly as the lanes' ONLY live trigger, so the
// assertions here are the wiring that keeps it alive — the schedule exists,
// both lanes accept it, nothing else rides it, and its failure files an
// issue. Restoring the pull-request path means reverting the commit that
// carried this change; the classifier script and its tests were left in
// place so that stays a revert.
